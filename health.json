It can be done by helping the person to slowly reduce the alcohol intake over time or by medications. Thus reducing the withdrawal symptoms\r\n\r\nCounseling - It includes self-help groups and talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)\r\n\r\nMedication - There are two main types of medicines to facilitate a person to stop drinking. The first is to help reduce withdrawal symptoms and is generally given in tapering doses over a short period of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most common medicine that\u2019s used in this way is called chlodiazapoxide (Librium).

                "There are many reasons for hair loss. It include following reasons:\r\nHair Disorders\r\n\r\nHereditary thinning or baldness: It is also calledandrogenetic alopecia. It is regarded as the most common cause of hair loss. Hereditary hair loss in men is seen as a receding hairline as well as hair loss on top of the scalp. Women, on the other hand, tends to have their hairline and have visible thinning of hair over the front and top of the scalp.\r\nAlopecia areata. It is an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss on the scalp and elsewhere on the body. It develops in people of all ages and hair is lost in patches\r\n\r\nCicatricial (scarring) alopecia: It can develop in otherwise healthy men and women, cicatricial alopecia is a rare condition that destroys hair follicles. Scar tissue forms where the follicles once were and re-growth is not possible. Treatment attempts to stop the inflammation that destroys the hair follicles.\r\n\r\nDisease\r\n\r\nUnderlying medical condition: Decreasing hair loss is regarded as warning sign for about 30 diseases. Hair loss often can be stopped or reversed with treatment for the underlying disease. Medical conditions that lead to hair loss are thyroid disease and anaemia caused by an iron deficiency.\r\n\r\nSome cancer treatments: Radiation therapy and some chemotherapeutic medications can also cause hair loss. While hair loss is usually temporary, it can be the most distressing part of therapy.\r\n\r\nRingworm of the scalp. Hair loss can also be caused due to fungal infection, which is most common in children, can cause balding and scaling on the scalp.\r\n\r\nTrichotillomania. It is a disorder that causes people to repeatedly pull out their own hair. Aside from a constant urge to pull out the hair on the scalp, sufferers often say they feel compelled to pull out their eyelashes, nose hair, eyebrows, and other hair on their bodies.\r\n\r\nStress and Hormones\r\n\r\nStress: Hair loss can also occur if a person is mentally or physically stressed, or after a major surgery, high fever, severe infection, or even flu.\r\n\r\nHormone fluctuations: Any change in hormonal levels can cause hair loss especially in women. Hair loss is common during menopause and after childbirth due to falling oestrogen levels. When hair loss is caused by falling oestrogen levels, the loss is usually temporary. Hair can be re grown .\r\n\r\nDiet\r\n\r\nWeight loss: People having weight issues can also have hair loss. This hair loss is common, and hair growth does return to normal with proper diet and weight.\r\n\r\nVitamin A excess: Intake of too much vitamin A through vitamin supplements or medications can also lead to hair loss.\r\nProtein intake too low: Hair loss can also occur when the body is not getting enough protein, it conserves the protein. It does get by shifting hair growth into the resting phase. Within 2 to 3 months, the person usually sees visible hair loss. This can be reversed and prevented by eating enough protein. \r\nIron intake too low. Consuming too little iron can lead to hair loss. Good vegetarian sources of iron are iron-fortified cereals, soybeans, pumpkin seeds, white beans, lentils, and spinach. Clams, oysters, and organ meats top the list of good animal sources of iron.\r\n\r\nEating disorder. An eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia is the other cause of hair loss.\r\n\r\nMedication\r\nMedications that can cause hair loss include:\r\n\r\nBlood thinners\r\nHigh-dose vitamin A\r\nMedicines for arthritis, depression, gout, heart problems, and high blood pressure\r\nBirth control pills: Some women taking or discontinuing birth control pills experience hair loss. This usually occurs in women with an inherited tendency toward hair thinning.\r\n\r\nHair Care Practices\r\n\r\nHair cosmetics: Frequent colouring of hair can cause the hair to break. Regular or improper use of dyes, gels, relaxers, and sprays also can cause hair breakage. Dermatologists recommend limiting use of these hair cosmetics to reduce hair breakage.\r\n\r\nBlow dryers, flat irons, and similar devices. Regular use of a blow dryer tends to damage hair. The high heat from a blow dryer can boil the water in the hair shaft leaving the hair brittle and prone to breakage. Allowing the hair to air dry and styling it only when dry will lessen this risk. Dermatologists also recommend limiting the use of flat irons, which straighten hair by using high heat, and other devices such as curling irons.\r\nHairpins, clips, and rubber bands: If hair are held tightly with hairpins, clips, and rubber bands, it can break hair. To minimize hair breakage, one should use loosely fitting clips and wear them in different areas of the scalp so that hair breakage is not localized in a specific area.\r\nToo much or vigorous grooming: Regular shampooing, combing, or brushing (100 strokes or more a day) or doing any of these too vigorously can cause hair breakage. When hair breakage occurs, the hair appears shaggy or too thin."

                "Treatment of hair loss depends upon the cause of disease.\r\nTreatment available without a prescription\r\n\r\n\r\nMinoxidil:This medicine is applied to the scalp. It can stop hair from getting thinner and also stimulate hair growth on the top of the scalp. It is the only hair re-growth product approved for men and women. A dermatologist generally combine minoxidil with another treatment.\r\nLaser devices:Brushes, combs, and other hand-held devices that emit laser light also stimulate hair growth. These devices might make hair look more youthful in some people. Because the FDA classifies these products as medical devices, the products do not undergo the rigorous testing that medicines undergo. The long-term effectiveness and safety for these devices are not known.\r\n\r\nPrescription medicine\r\nFinasteride:The FDA approved this medicine to treat men with hair loss. It comes in pill form and helps slow hair loss in most (about 88%) men. It helps stimulate hair re-growth in many (about 66%) men. Finasteride works by stopping the body from making a male hormone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT).\r\n\r\nCorticosteroid:If your hair loss is caused by inflammation in body, a dermatologist may inject a medicine called a corticosteroid into scalp. This can help stop the inflammation that happens when a person has alopecia areata. A corticosteroid is different from an anabolic steroid.\r\n\r\nProcedures\r\nThe type of procedure that a dermatologist recommends will depend on how much hairyou have lost. To achieve the best results, a dermatologist may use one or more of the following procedures:\r\n\r\nHair transplantation:Skin on the scalp that has good hair growth is removed and transplanted to areas of the scalp that need hair.\r\nScalp reduction:Bald scalp is surgically removed and hair-bearing scalp is brought closer together to reduce balding. Scalp reduction surgery can be performed alone or in conjunction with a hair transplant.\r\nScalp expansion:Devices are inserted under the scalp for about 3 to 4 weeks to stretch the skin. This procedure may be performed before a scalp reduction to make the scalp more lax. It also can be performed solely to stretch hair-bearing areas, which reduces balding.\r\nScalp flaps:A hair-bearing segment of scalp is surgically moved and placed where hair is needed."

                "HIV test is done to detect human immunodeficiency virus in saliva, serum or urine. The UNAIDS/WHO policy statement on HIV Testing states that conditions under which people undergo HIV testing must be anchored in a human rights approach that pays due respect to ethical principles . According to these principles, the conduct of HIV testing of individuals must address:\r\nConfidentiality:The entire process of testing and results are kept confidential to give boost toindividuals, couples, and families to learn about their HIV status in the convenience and privacy of their home environment.Home-Based HIV Testing and Counseling (HBHTC) allows rapid HIV tests that are most often used, so that results are available for the client between 15 and 30 minutes. It is:\r\n\r\nAccompanied by counselling (for those who test positive).\r\nConducted with informed consent of the person being tested.\r\n\r\nIn diagnosis of HIV/AIDS several tests can help physician to determine what stage of the disease it is. These tests include:\r\nWindow period:There is a period of time between HIV infection and the appearance of anti-HIV antibodies that can be measured which is called \"window period\".Antibody tests may give false negative (no antibodies are detected despite the presence of HIV) results during the window period, an interval of three weeks to six months between the time of HIV infection and the production of measurable antibodies to HIV sero conversion.\r\nCD4 count: CD4 cells are a type of white blood cell that's specifically targeted and destroyed by HIV. A healthy person's CD4 count can vary from 500 to more than 1,000. Even if a person has no symptoms, HIV infection progresses to AIDS when his or her CD4 count becomes less than 200.\r\nRapid or point-of-care tests:The rapid test is an immunoassay used for screening, and it produces quick results, in 20 minutes or less. Rapid tests use blood or oral fluid to look for antibodies to HIV. If an immunoassay (lab test or rapid test) is conducted during the window period (i.e., the period after exposure but before the test can find antibodies), the test may not find antibodies and may give a false negative result. All immunoassays that are positive need a follow up test to confirm the result.\r\nELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay):ELISA is set of blood tests used to diagnose HIV infection. ELISA test is performed by inserting a needle to draw blood. A positive result on the ELISA screening test does not necessarily mean that the person has HIV infection. Certain conditions may lead to a false positive result, such as Lyme disease, syphilis, and lupus.\r\nRNA tests: It detects the virus directly (instead of the antibodies to HIV) and thus can detect HIV at about 10 days after infection, as soon as it appears in the bloodstream, before antibodies develop. These tests cost more than antibody tests and are generally not used as a screening test, although doctor may order one as a follow-up test, after a positive antibody test, or as part of a clinical workup.\r\nWestern Blot:A positive ELISA test is always followed by a Western blot test which confirm HIV infection.\r\n*NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any treatment and diagnosis purpose you should consult your physician."

Blood loss can be short term or long term depending upon the conditions.\r\nBleeding in the digestive or urinary tract can cause blood loss. Surgery, trauma, or cancer also can cause blood loss. Heavy blood loss due to menstruation.\r\nIf a lot of blood is lost, the body may lose enough red blood cells to cause anaemia.\r\n2) Lack of Red Blood cell production:\r\nIt can be due to \"acquired\" or \"Inherited\".\r\n\"Acquired\" means that the person is not born with the condition, but may develop it at later stages.\r\n\"Inherited\" means that the condition has been passed by the parents.]\r\nAcquired conditions and factors that can lead to anaemia include:\r\nPoor diet\r\nUnusual hormonal levels\r\nChronic diseases\r\nPregnancy\r\nAplastic anaemia can also prevent body from making enough red blood cells. This condition can be both acquired or inherited.\r\n3) High rates of RBCs destruction:\r\nFactors that can cause destruction of red blood cells.\r\nOne condition can be an enlarged or diseased spleen.This is an acquired condition.\r\nInherited conditions are the one when body destroy too many red blood cells. It can be in sickle cell anaemia, thalassemias, and lack of certain enzymes. These conditions create defects in the red blood cells that cause them to die faster than healthy red blood cells.\r\nHemolytic anaemia is another example of a condition in which body destroys its red blood cells. Both inherited or acquired conditions or other factors can cause hemolytic anaemia. Examples include immune disorders, infections, certain medicines, or reactions to blood transfusions."

Symptoms are generally worse at night and in the early morning or in response to allergens.\r\nWhen uncontrolled, there may be acute asthma attacks often occurring after viral infections (flu, cold), allergen/irritant exposure (pets, pollen, dust, atmospheric pollution, tobacco smoke), exercise, weather changes, medications (aspirin). Danger signs of an acute asthma attack are symptoms not improving after airway-opener inhaler medication, and difficulty in talking due to breathlessness, peak flow-meter readings ranging below 50% of normal value, and require urgent medical attention.\r\nA number of other health conditions are found associated with asthma including:\r\n\r\nGastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD)\r\nRhinosinusitis\r\nObstructive sleep apnea"

It is primarily a disease of herbivorous animals particularly cattles sheep, goats, horses and mules. The disease naturally occurs among herbivorous animals through contaminated soil and feed; among omnivorous and carnivorous animals through contaminated meat, bone meals or other feeds; and among wild animals from feeding on anthrax infected carcasses. Infected animals shed the bacilli in terminal hemorrhage or spilt blood at death. Anthrax spores can persist in soil for many years.\r\nHumans almost invariably contract the natural disease directly or indirectly from animals or animal products.\r\nAnthrax is existed in many parts of the world, including Asia, southern Europe, sub-Sahelian Africa and parts of Australia. Anthrax also called Malignant pustule, Malignant oedema, Woolsorter's disease, or Ragpicker's disease\r\nAnthrax is enzootic (normally present in an areain animals) in southern India but is less frequent to absent in the northern Indian States. In the past years the anthrax cases have been reported from Andhra Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Orissa and Karnataka.\r\nIntegrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), National Centre for disease control (NCDC), Delhi, India reported 6 outbreaks of anthrax in India during the year 2014.\r\nBioterrorism and Anthrax:\r\nAnthrax is considered an important biological warfare agent because:\r\n(i) it is highly fatal and when transmitted through inhalation is almost always fatal,\r\n(ii) anthrax spores can remain viable for several decades and can be easily produced in large quantities at a very low cost, and\r\n(iii) it is easy to weaponize and disseminate anthrax as an odourless and invisible aerosol which can affect thousands of people at the same time."

Cutaneous anthrax accounts for most of the cases in endemic situation.\r\nCutaneous, or skin, anthrax is the most common form. It is usually contracted when a person with a break in their skin, such as a cut or abrasion, comes into direct contact with anthrax spores. The resulting itchy bump rapidly develops into a black sore. Some people can then develop headaches, muscle aches, fever and vomiting. Cutaneous anthrax usually occurs after exposure to infected animals or their contaminated tissues and products such as hair, hides, wool, bones and skin.\r\nGastrointestinal anthrax is caught from eating meat from an infected animal. It causes initial symptoms similar to food poisoning but these can worsen to produce severe abdominal pain, vomiting of blood and severe diarrhea.\r\nPulmonary anthrax- The most severe form of human anthrax is called inhalation or pulmonary anthrax. Though the rarest, it is the form of human anthrax causing the most current concern. This form of the disease is caused when a person is directly exposed to a large number of anthrax spores suspended in the air, and breathes them in. The first symptoms are similar to those of a common cold, but this can rapidly progress to severe breathing difficulties and shock."

                "Atherosclerosis usually doesn't cause signs and symptoms until it severely narrows or totally blocks an artery. Many people don't know they have the disease until they have a medical emergency, such as heart attackorstroke.\r\nSome people may have signs and symptoms of the disease. Signs and symptoms will depend on which arteries are affected.\r\nCoronary Arteries\r\nThe coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to heart. If plaque narrows or blocks these arteries (a disease calledcoronary heart disease, or CHD), it may lead to angina. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.\r\nAngina may feel like pressure or squeezing in chest. Pain may also be felt in shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion. The pain tends to get worse with activity and go away with rest. Emotional stress also can trigger the pain.\r\nOther symptoms of CHD are shortness of breath andarrhythmiasArrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat.\r\nPlaque also can form in the heart's smallest arteries. This disease is calledcoronary microvascular disease(MVD). Symptoms of coronary MVD include angina, shortness of breath, sleep problems, fatigue (tiredness), and lack of energy.\r\nCarotid Arteries\r\nThe carotid arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to brain. If plaque narrows or blocks these arteries (a disease calledcarotid artery disease), one may have symptoms of stroke. These symptoms may include:\r\n\r\nSudden weakness\r\nParalysis (an inability to move) or numbness of the face, arms, or legs, especially on one side of the body\r\nConfusion\r\nTrouble speaking or understanding speech\r\nTrouble seeing in one or both eyes\r\nDifficulty in breathing\r\nDizziness, trouble walking, loss of balance or coordination, and unexplained falls\r\nLoss of consciousness\r\nSudden and severe headache\r\n\r\nPeripheral Arteries\r\nPlaque also can build up in the major arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to the legs, arms, and pelvis (a disease calledperipheral artery disease).\r\nIf these major arteries are narrowed or blocked, you may have numbness, pain, and sometimes dangerous infections.\r\nRenal Arteries\r\nThe renal arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to kidneys. If plaque builds up in these arteries, one may developchronic kidney disease. Over time, chronic kidney disease causes a slow loss of kidney function.\r\nEarly kidney disease often has no signs or symptoms. As the disease gets worse, it can cause tiredness, changes in how you urinate (more often or less often), loss of appetite, nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), swelling in the hands or feet, itchiness or numbness and trouble concentrating."

                "The exact cause of atherosclerosis isn't known. However, studies show that atherosclerosis is a slow, complex disease that may start in childhood. It develops faster as you age.\r\nAtherosclerosis may start when certain factors damage the inner layers of the arteries. These factors include:\r\n\r\nSmoking\r\nHigh amounts of certain fats andcholesterolin the blood\r\nHigh blood pressure\r\nHigh amounts of sugar in the blood due toinsulin resistanceordiabetes\r\n\r\nRisk Factors\r\nThe exact cause of atherosclerosis is not clear but certain traits, conditions, or habits may raise risk for the disease. These conditions are known as risk factors. The more risk factors you have, the more likely it is that you'll develop atherosclerosis.\r\nMajor Risk Factors\r\n\r\nUnhealthy blood cholesterol levels. This includes high LDL cholesterol (sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol) and low HDL cholesterol (sometimes called \"good\" cholesterol).\r\nHigh blood pressure. Blood pressure is considered high if it stays at or above 140/90 mmHg over time. If you have diabetes orchronic kidney disease, high blood pressure is defined as 130/80 mmHg or higher. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercury\u2014the units used to measure blood pressure.)\r\nSmoking. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels, raise cholesterol levels, and raise blood pressure. Smoking also doesn't allow enough oxygen to reach body tissues.\r\nInsulin resistance. This condition occurs if the body can't use its insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into cells where it's used as an energy source. Insulin resistance may lead to diabetes.\r\nDiabetes. With this disease, the body's blood sugar level is too high because the body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use its insulin properly.\r\nOverweight or obesity. The terms \"overweight\" and \"obesity\" refer to body weight that's greater than what is considered healthy for a certain height.\r\nLack ofphysical activity. A lack of physical activity can worsen other risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, and overweight and obesity.\r\nUnhealthy diet. An unhealthy diet can raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Foods that are high in saturated andtransfats, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and sugar can worsen other atherosclerosis risk factors.\r\nOlder age. As one gets older, risk for atherosclerosis increases. Genetic or lifestyle factors cause plaque to build up in arteries with ageing. By the time you're middle-aged or older, enough plaque has built up to cause signs or symptoms. In men, the risk increases after the age of 45. In women, the risk increases after the age of 55.\r\nFamily history of early heart disease. Your risk for atherosclerosis increases if your father or a brother was diagnosed with heart disease before 55 years of age, or if your mother or a sister was diagnosed with heart disease before 65 years of age."

All sexual partners should also be examined for other sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhoea, syphilis and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is prudent to treat all members of the household with antibiotics. There should be abstinence from sexual activity until the course of treatment is complete.\r\nThe goal of pharmacotherapy is to reduce morbidity and to prevent any complications.\r\nEmpiric antimicrobial therapy must be comprehensive and should cover all likely pathological organisms.\r\nConjunctivitis is usually an ocular manifestation of a sexually transmitted uro-genital infection. Therefore, adult inclusion conjunctivitis does not respond and topical use of antibiotic is relatively not effective.\r\nPatients should be followed-up for about 2-6 weeks after initiation of treatment, depending upon the severity of initial symptoms.\r\nTreatment consists of:\r\n- Systemic antibiotics: Systemic antibiotics are usually recommended for about 3-6 weeks. Systemic oral antibiotics such as erythromycin, azithromycin, tetracycline or doxycycline may be used.\r\n\r\n\u2018Single-dose azithromycin should be considered as equally reliable treatment option, comparing to long-term alternative regimens for adult inclusion conjunctivitis.

                "Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) is a relatively uncommon, but potentially blinding ocular (eye) disease, which typically affects young people with atopic dermatitis. AKC is a severe chronic inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva which may have dramatic consequences for visual function.\r\nThe incidence of atopic dermatitis is greatest in paediatric population. AKC may occur at any time after the onset of the associated dermatitis or other atopic condition, and is not necessarily correlated with exacerbations of these conditions. The initial presentation of ocular symptoms in AKC most commonly occurs in the second to third decade of life, with some patients presenting earlier or later (range varies from late teens to 50 years with peak age of incidence in people aged 30-50 years). Visually significant complications most frequently occur in the fourth to fifth decades, with more men affected than women. The condition then remains chronic for years, usually requiring lifelong treatment. An earlier onset of AKC carries the greatest risk for tear film abnormalities and greater ocular surface damage. Classically involved skin areas of atopic dermatitis are lateral neck folds, antecubital (in-front of the elbow) and popliteal (back of knee joint) fossae, but may involve other parts of body including eyelid.\r\nIn the year 1952, Hogan described bilateral conjunctivitis occurring in patients with atopic dermatitis (coined the term atopic keratoconjunctivitis), which flared-up with worsening dermatitis. Patients notably showed chronic conjunctival hyperaemia and thickening, corneal epitheliopathy, and later corneal scarring and neovascularisation. Atopic keratoconjunctivitis may evolve independent of dermatitis in some patients. Hogan\u2019s criteria to aid in diagnosis is presence or history of eczematous dermatitis, a family history of atopic disease, associated allergies (asthma, hay fever), eosinophilia and a characteristic keratoconjunctivitis associated with exacerbations of dermatitis. His patients were notable for chronic conjunctival hyperaemia and thickening, corneal epitheliopathy, and later corneal scarring and neovascularisation.\r\nAtopic keratoconjunctivitis represents a disease under chronic allergic conjunctivitis (CAC), together with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and, to a certain extent, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC). The potential for corneal involvement and opacification increases significantly with the CACs because of the severity and sustained nature of their inflammation. In seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival inflammation is quite mild and corneal involvement is rare. However, clinical and patho-physiological features of AKC are quite different from other allergic conjunctivitis. AKC like vernal keratoconjunctivitis, is a severe inflammatory disease, which may involve cornea and can cause permanent visual impairment. The highest incidence of visual loss is therefore, found in AKC, the most chronic of these disorders.\r\nChronic allergic conjunctivitis characteristically involves an Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated type I hypersensitivity response, manifested by papillary conjunctivitis, with itching as a universal early symptom. Hypersensitivity reactions associated with type I and a prominent T-cell mediated type IV response, along with variety of other inflammatory cell types and cytokines, contribute to the inflammatory changes of conjunctiva and cornea seen in AKC.\r\nAKC and VKC are more frequently associated with eczema and asthma respectively, while SAC and PAC are more frequently associated with rhinitis.\r\nAKC tends to be chronic and unremitting, with a relatively low expectation of eventual resolution, and is associated with significant ocular morbidity. VKC is more frequently seasonal, and is generally worse in the spring season. AKC tends to be perennial and is often worse in winter. Patients are sensitive to a wide range of airborne environmental allergens."

                "Atopic keratoconjunctivitis is a chronic allergic conjunctivitis and may be due to:\r\nHypersensitivity response:\r\nAll ocular allergic disorders are characterised by a hypersensitivity response, defined as an excessive reaction of the normal immune system, usually by exposure to an inciting antigen.\r\nType I hypersensitivity, or IgE mediated immediate hypersensitivity, predominates in PAC and SAC, but is also involved in other CACs, including AKC. Serum IgE levels are chronically elevated in AKC patients but their levels are not necessarily correlated to severity of disease. IgE levels in tear samples are also increased in AKC, and correlate with serum IgE levels.\r\nAKC additionally involves a chronic inflammation of the ocular surface; a type IV delayed hypersensitivity response, where an immediate antigen is not easily identified.\r\nGenetic predisposition:\r\nA genetic predisposition combined with antigen sensitisation is suspected in AKC and its associated disease, atopic dermatitis. AKC may, however, represent either a common manifestation end point for a number of abnormal gene processes, or a single gene defect with variable phenotypic expression, modified by other gene polymorphisms and the environment.\r\nEpithelial barrier defect:\r\nMore recent studies suggest that an epithelial barrier defect may be responsible rather than a defect in immune-regulatory function.\r\n\r\nAtopic (genetic tendency to develop allergic disease) systemic diseases with which AKC may be associated are:\r\n- Dermatitis is most common.\r\n- Eczema.\r\n- Asthma.\r\n- Hay Fever.\r\n- Migraine.\r\n- Urticaria (hives).\r\n- Rhinitis.\r\n- Food allergies (less common).\r\n- Non-hereditary angioedema (less common).\r\nAKC may be associated with other ocular diseases like:\r\n- Keratoconus.\r\n- Anterior sub-capsular cataract.\r\n- Posterior sub-capsular cataract.\r\n- Chronic staphylococcal blepharitis.\r\n- Retinal detachment."

                "Diagnosis of AKC is based upon typical clinical features.\r\nDespite facts suggesting immune responses in the pathogenesis of VKC, no clinical or laboratory test has evolved to support the diagnosis in atypical cases or predict the course of disease.\r\nHistory of atopy in patient or the family, elevated serum level of total and specific IgE, higher number of eosinophils and mast cells, increased level of mediators and favourable response to anti-allergic therapy is observed in AKC.\r\n\r\nOcular clinical features:\r\nPeri-orbital features:\r\n-Dermatitis: Scaling, flaky dermatitis consistent with eczema on peri-orbital skin.\r\n-Hyperpigmentation: Peri-orbital hyper-pigmentation, which may lighten in response to control of inflammation.\r\n-de Hertoghe sign: de Hertoghe sign or absence of lateral eyebrow, is occasionally seen and may be related to chronic eye rubbing.\r\nEyelids:\r\n-Dermatitis: Scaling, flaky dermatitis with reddened base, consistent with eczema on eyelids.\r\n-Vertical corrugations: Vertical corrugations near medial canthus of upper and lower eyelid may result.\r\n-Fissured eyelid skin: Eyelid skin is often fissured.\r\n-Eyelid margin thickening: Eyelid margins may be thickened, oedematous and hyperaemic.\r\n-Dennie-Morgan lines: Eyelid oedema may lead to Dennie-Morgan lines, single or double creases in the lower eyelid, secondary to chronic eye rubbing.\r\n-Lateral canthal ulceration: Lateral canthal ulceration related to chronic tearing may be present.\r\n-Lid mal-position: Lid mal-position may result from chronic eyelid oedema and inflammation, resulting into:\r\n 1. Ectropion (outward turning of eyelid).\r\n 2. Ptosis. \r\n 3. Lagophthalmos may result from chronic eyelid oedema and inflammation.\r\n-Madarosis: Madarosis may also result from chronic eyelid oedema and inflammation. Lid margins may show loss of cilia and punctal ectropion.\r\n-Permanent lid swelling: Chronic oedema may lead to permanent lid swelling, a hallmark of long-standing atopic eye disease.\r\n-Eyelid margin keratinisation: Keratinisation of eyelid margins is sometimes observed, along with associated meibomitis (inflammation of meibomian glands) and obliteration of meibomian glands.\r\n\r\nConjunctiva:\r\n-Palpebral conjunctiva: Palpebral conjunctiva shows papillary hypertrophy, more prominent on lower tarsus.\r\n-Giant papillae: Giant papillae like VKC may form.\r\n-Oedema: Diffuse sheet-like infiltration of conjunctiva may lead to pale white oedema and obscuration of blood vessels. Bulbar conjunctiva typically displays diffuse chemosis and injection.\r\n-Conjuctival scarring: Conjuctival scarring may occur, often in reticular or septal pattern.\r\n-Symblepharon (adhesion between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) formation: Sub-epithelial fibrosis can, in severe cases, lead to symblepharon formation.\r\n-Forniceal foreshortening: Forniceal foreshortening may also result from sub-epithelial fibrosis.\r\n-Limbus: Limbus may become infiltrated and oedematous, and develop gelatinous limbal thickening, consisting of confluent macro-papillae, is sometimes seen.\r\n-Trantas dots: Trantas dots, tiny white lesions consisting of necrotic epithelial cells and eosinophils, may be observed, similar to those in VKC.\r\nCornea:\r\nCorneal disease may be complicated by late development of corneal hypaesthesia in patients with AKC, resulting in a paradoxic reduction in surface symptoms, including itching.\r\n-Punctate epithelial keratopathy: Punctate epithelial keratopathy is the most common corneal finding.\r\n-Filamentary keratitis: Filamentary keratitis may occur, sometimes with very thick mucoid filamentary strands and possibly related to tear film instability, due to goblet cell abnormalities and deficient mucin secretion, also commonly featured in AKC.\r\n-Persistent epithelial defects: Persistent epithelial defects frequently occur in the setting of a dry and inflamed ocular surface and may eventually lead to macro-erosions. Macro-erosions in atopic patient may progress to frank bacterial ulcers.\r\n-Atopic shield ulcers with \u2018vernal\u2019 plaque formation: Atopic shield ulcers with \u2018vernal\u2019 plaque formation may also develop. Adherent mucus plaques contain epithelial debris, eosinophils, and inflammatory cells, and probably result from a combination of mechanical irritation from giant papillae, as well as toxic epithelial changes secondary to inflammation. Persistence of these plaques may eventually cause stromal thinning and perforation. The chronic inflammation and mechanical insult from palpebral scarring may result in partial or total limbal stem cell deficiency. Chronic inflammation and superimposed infection may lead to corneal scarring, neovascularisation, and lipid deposition. Vision may decline due to obscuration of the visual axis, irregular astigmatism, and/or ocular surface compromise.\r\n-Pannus formation: Severe pannus often develops, typically affecting the superior one-third of the cornea.\r\n-Pseudogerontoxon: Pseudogerontoxon may be seen in the peripheral cornea, which resembles a short, circumferential segment of arcus-senilis (white or grey opaque ring in corneal margin). This localised area of lipid deposition, related to abnormal vascular permeability at the limbus, may be the only evidence of previous atopic disease in a quiet eye.\r\nOther complications/features:\r\n-Eyelid inflammation: Eyelid inflammation is common in AKC, often related to staphylococcal blepharitis. Patients with atopic dermatitis are found to have high rates of bacterial skin colonisation, specifically with staphylococcal species.\r\n-Corneal super-infections: AKC patients are at higher risk of corneal super-infections because of an unstable ocular surface, the local bacterial colonisation of the eyelids, and a dysfunctional innate immune system. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis, frequently bilateral, is another well known complication of AKC, and is presumably related to abnormalities in the atopic host\u2019s immune defences. Herpetic epithelial lesions may be recurrent, especially when topical or systemic immune-suppressants are required to control the atopic state. Management is especially difficult because epithelial AKC lesions may be difficult to distinguish from HSV keratitis.\r\n-Development of cataract: Rapidly progressive cataracts frequently develop in AKC patients, classically described as anterior sub-capsular opacities, usually stellate or shield like in appearance. The pathogenesis for atopic cataract is unclear, and it is suggested that high levels of IgE may be correlated with development of cataract in these patients. The chronic use of topical steroids also predisposes to posterior sub-capsular cataracts in AKC patients. Other forms of cataract may form independent of corticosteroid use, especially in patients with severe systemic atopic disease.\r\n-Keratoconus: A higher incidence of keratoconus is reported in AKC, likely related in part to chronic eye rubbing.\r\n-Pellucid marginal degeneration: A higher incidence of pellucid marginal degeneration is reported in AKC, likely related in part to chronic eye rubbing.\r\n-Retinal detachment: Slightly higher rate of retinal detachment has also been noted in AKC patients. This may also be related to chronic eye rubbing, inducing degenerative vitreous changes.\r\nHistological/ Immuno-histochemical studies:\r\nHistological/ Immuno-histochemical studies of conjunctival specimens reveal increased number of mast cells, eosinophils, T lymphocytes and neutrophils in AKC patients.\r\nMast cells and eosinophils have not only been detected in conjunctival epithelium, but are also present in increased numbers in the substantia propria. A surplus of Langerhans cells, macrophages and B cells in the substantia propria is also seen.\r\nT-lymphocyte infiltration is apparent in both conjunctival epithelium and substantia propria in AKC. T-helper (Th) cells predominate in all allergic eye diseases. Of the major T-cell subtypes, the Th1 subtype is involved in cellular immunity, whereas Th2 subtype is involved in humoral immune responses, including those mediated by IgE. Th2 cells are involved in eosinophil recruitment and stimulate IgE production from B cells. Th2 cytokines are involved in the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells in AKC.\r\nActivated eosinophils recruit additional inflammatory cells to the ocular surface. They release chemo-attractants which attract neutrophils to the conjunctiva. Eosinophils are also major players in the development of sight-threatening corneal complications in AKC.\r\nConjunctival Epithelial cells and Fibroblasts express pro-inflammatory mediators in VKC. The expression of surface adhesion molecules and the release of cytokines by epithelial cells enhance recruitment of eosinophils. Conjunctival fibroblasts, when activated by Th cytokines, promote local accumulation of eosinophils and enhance eosinophil degranulation.\r\n\r\nSecondary structural changes:\r\nExtensive inflammation in AKC leads to chronic ocular surface alterations:\r\n-Goblet cell loss/hyperplasia: Both goblet cell loss (based on impression cytology), as well as goblet cell hyperplasia (based on conjunctival biopsy) have been reported. Goblet cell production of mucin is altered.\r\n-Tear film instability: Tear film instability, with increased tear break-up time (BUT) but normal tear production, has also been described.\r\n-Corneal sensation: Corneal sensations are reduced in AKC..\r\n-Squamous metaplasia: Squamous metaplasia has also been described in patients with AKC.\r\nConfocal microscopy studies:\r\nAKC is associated with alterations in basal epithelium and sub-basal corneal nerves which relate to changes in tear function and corneal sensitivity. There is lower density of basal epithelial cells. A decrease in number and density of sub-basal long nerve fibers causes decreased corneal sensation. Corneal nerves are thickened and have bifurcation abnormalities. Inflammatory cells and activated keratocytes are found in the superficial stroma.\r\nAKC should be differentiated from:\r\n- Chronic allergic conjunctivitis (e.g. VKC).\r\n- Blepharitis.\r\n- Viral conjunctivitis.\r\n- Trachoma.\r\n- Cicatricial pemphigoid.\r\n\r\nSimilarities and differentiation from VKC:\r\nSimilarities:\r\n- Potentially blinding chronic disease: AKC and VKC are chronic, potentially blinding conditions.\r\n- Atopy: Both conditions present in individuals predisposed by an atopic background.\r\n- Hypersensitivity responses: Both diseases involve both type I and type IV hypersensitivity responses. Eosinophils and T lymphocytes are found to infiltrate the conjunctiva in both conditions.\r\n- Clinical features: Clinically, they are similar, with conjunctival inflammation, epithelial defects, shield ulcers, and corneal scarring as major features of both.\r\nDifferences:\r\n- Age groups: AKC presents at an older age than VKC. VKC usually \u2018burns out\u2019 by late puberty, whereas AKC remains chronic for years, often persisting into old age, when it may resolve spontaneously.\r\n- Visual prognosis: Visual prognosis is worse for AKC.\r\n- Peri-orbital skin and eyelid: There is increased peri-orbital and eyelid skin involvement in AKC as compared to VKC which generally spare skin.\r\n- Papillae: AKC usually presents with micro-papillae on the palpebral conjunctiva. Lower tarsus is preferentially involved in AKC, in contrast to VKC, in which papillae are much more prominent on the upper tarsus. Giant papillae are sometimes seen in AKC, but this is a definitive hallmark of VKC.\r\n- Eyelid margins: The eyelid margins are affected in AKC unlike VKC. Cicatricial changes, forniceal foreshortening, and symblepharon may be seen in AKC which are not usual in VKC.\r\n- Trantas dots: Trantas dots are more frequently associated with VKC than AKC."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nBecause of chronic nature of AKC, the balance of treatment efficacy and risk is often difficult. AKC is generally less responsive and requires more intensive and prolonged treatment.\r\nThe approach to management is multifaceted with the purpose of improving patient comfort and preventing the complications associated with AKC. Management involves multiple treatment arms viz. topical mast cell stabilisers, corticosteroids, steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents such as topical cyclosporine. In more severe cases, systemic immune-suppression may be required.\r\n\r\nGeneral measures:\r\n-Environmental allergens: Control of environmental allergens may be helpful, but antigen avoidance is usually an adjunctive therapy.\r\n-Eyelid hygiene: Because AKC involve the eyelids, in addition to the ocular surface, basic eyelid hygiene is essential. Eyelid scrubs should be part of daily routine in order to control blepharitis and the risk of staphylococcal keratitis. Antibiotic ointment may also be applied to the eyelid margins.\r\n-Warm/cold compresses: Warm compresses improve tear film stability in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction related to eyelid margin inflammation.\r\n    If severe itching or an exacerbation of peri-ocular atopic dermatitis is present, cold compresses will be more likely to provide symptomatic relief.\r\n\r\nMedical therapy:\r\nAKC is primarily managed medically. However, elective surgery may be of benefit where inflammation is well controlled.\r\nThe goal of therapy should be the complete control of ocular surface inflammation with the safest medicines and lowest dosing needed to achieve this.\r\nMast cell stabilisers and antihistamines are the mainstay of prophylactic therapy. Antihistamines, steroids and immune-suppressants are used for immediate management of symptoms.\r\n\r\nEyelids:\r\n-Emollients: Emollients applied to the eyelid skin help control peri-ocular eczema.\r\n-Steroid ointments: Mild steroid ointments also help in controlling peri-ocular eczema. As with eye-drops, the duration of treatment should be minimised and the intraocular pressure monitored.\r\n-Immunosuppressive agent: Tacrolimus ointment, a steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent, has also been shown to be effective in treating atopic dermatitis of the eyelids.\r\n\r\nOcular surface:\r\n-Topical artificial tears: Superficial punctate keratopathy requires aggressive lubrication, with preservative-free artificial tears and lubricating ointments, with the goal of increasing comfort and avoiding frank epithelial defects, which are typically more difficult to manage in atopes.\r\n-Topical antibiotic: If epithelial erosion does occur, topical antibiotic prophylaxis should be added to prevent bacterial super-infection and infectious keratitis, a complication of epithelial defects in AKC. All new epithelial defects should be cultured prior to initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics.\r\n-Bandage contact lens: Bandage contact lens may be applied to facilitate healing of the corneal epithelial defect.\r\n-Scleral contact lenses: In patients with corneal epithelial or stromal irregularity but with good control of their AKC, scleral contact lenses may afford good vision and increased comfort, thus avoiding surgery.\r\n-Topical acetylcysteine: Acetylcysteine, a mucolytic agent, may be used topically for dissolving mucus filaments and deposits, and addressing early plaque formation.\r\n-Topical antihistamines: Antihistamine eye drops are prescribed for the relief of acute signs and symptoms of AKC by blocking the histamine receptors in the conjunctiva. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus. These are generally not for continuous long term use, and several preparations are used in courses of limited duration. For allergic complaints limited to eyes, topical anti-histamines are prescribed and are free of untoward side-effects of systemic oral anti-histamines. Topical anti-histamines provide faster relief than systemic anti-histamines and have longer duration of action than topical vasoconstrictors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pure mast cell stabilisers and corticosteroids, the drugs commonly used in the treatment of ocular allergy. Examples include pyrilamine and pheniramine.Topical antihistamines when used in isolation are about as effective as mast cell stabilisers. They are suitable for acute exacerbations but generally not for continuous long term use, and courses of several preparations are used in courses of limited duration.\r\n-Systemic antihistamines: Systemic antihistamines help itching, promote sleep and reduce nocturnal eye rubbing. Because other inflammatory mediators are involved besides histamines, effectiveness is not assured. Some antihistamines (e.g.loratadine) cause relatively little drowsiness.\r\n-Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine: Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine like antazoline (antihistamine) with xylometazoline (vasoconstrictor) may offer relief in some cases.\r\n-Topical mast cell stabilisers: Initial management of conjunctival inflammation may involve topical mast cell stabilisers. Topical mast cell stabilisers reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations and the need for steroids and so form the basis of many regimens, but are seldom effective in isolation. Several days to weeks of treatment are needed for a reasonable response. The mast cell stabilisers include sodium cromoglycate, nedocromil, lodoxamide and pemirolast, which may be effective as maintenance therapy in mild cases of AKC.\r\n-Topical selective second-generation H1-blocking antihistamines: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. The enhanced clinical efficacy of these medicines over first-generation anti-histamines like pheniramine may be due to inhibitory effects of new-generation anti-histamines on the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines are much more selective for peripheral H1 receptors, as opposed to the central nervous system H1 receptors, cholinergic receptors, and some H2 receptors that cause cardiac arrhythmia. This selectivity significantly reduces the occurrence of adverse drug reactions, such as drowsiness/ sedative action, dry eye and dry mouth.\r\n-Selective H1-blocking antihistamines and topical mast cell stabilisers (Dual acting drugs): Agents such as azelastine, epinastine, bepotastine, olopatadine and ketotifen have both mast cell-stabilising and anti-histamine properties, and are more frequently employed for allergic eye diseases. These agents have a relatively rapid onset of action.Although these agents have little direct effect on the T-cell mediated inflammation, they may reduce overall induction of inflammation and, importantly, reduce mechanical eye rubbing, associated with the development of keratoconus and possibly AKC-associated cataract.\r\n-Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory preparations: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory preparations like ketorolac and diclofenac may improve comfort by blocking non-histamine mediators. Combining one of these with a mast cell stabiliser is an effective regimen in some patients.\r\n-Topical corticosteroid therapy: More severe inflammation in AKC usually requires topical corticosteroid therapy. Topical steroids must be prescribed only for a short period of time and for severe cases that do not respond to other therapy. Pulse dosing of topical steroids may be employed, followed by maintenance with an MC stabiliser. Modified steroids such as loteprednol etabonate and rimexolone may be used, and loteprednol has superior safety profile. Since the inflammation in AKC is on the ocular surface, corticosteroids with significant intraocular penetration should be avoided when possible. Steroid-related side effects, such as cataract and elevated intraocular pressure are often inevitable for AKC patients. Superior tarsal injection of corticosteroids is effective in refractory cases, though this treatment option may also be limited by side effects.\r\n-Topical immune-modulator drugs: Steroid-sparing immunosuppressive drugs, such as topical cyclosporine, have immune-modulatory effect by reducing Th cells, B cells and macrophages after treatment. Side effects include intense stinging and prolonged blurred vision. Tacrolimus ointment also inhibits T-cell production with greater potency than cyclosporine.\r\n-Systemic immune suppression: Advanced and refractory AKC may sometimes necessitate systemic immune-suppression, in order to prevent sight-threatening complications. Agents reported to be beneficial include prednisone, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and azathioprine.\r\n    The benefits of immune-suppressants, both systemic and local, must be balanced against the significant risk of infection, both bacterial and viral.\r\n- Allergen desensitisation: Allergen desensitisation may be effective in some patients with high serum IgE levels.\r\n-Plasmapheresis: Plasmapheresis may be done in some patients with high serum IgE levels.\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\n-Superficial keratectomy: Shield ulcer plaques, consisting of epithelial and inflammatory debris at the base of an ulcer, often are resistant to treatment with topical anti-inflammatory therapy. Superficial keratectomy may be required to remove plaques or debride shield ulcers and allow epithelialisation. Medical treatment must be maintained until the cornea has re-epithelialised in order to prevent recurrences.\r\n-Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy is an alternative to remove plaques or debride shield ulcers and allow epithelialisation.\r\n-Penetrating keratoplasty (full-thickness corneal transplant): Corneal scarring and occasionally perforation may occur in severe cases and necessitate penetrating keratoplasty.\r\n-Papillary resection: Papillary resection with or without mitomycin-C (MMC) application has been described as a method to reduce ocular surface inflammation.\r\n-Surface maintenance/restoration procedures: Surface maintenance/restoration procedures may be required for severe persistent epithelial defects or ulceration. Various procedures may be:\r\n    1. Amniotic membrane overlay grafting.\r\n    2. Lamellar keratoplasty (partial-thickness corneal transplant).\r\n    3. Eyelid procedures such as botulinum toxin-induced ptosis or lateral tarsorrhaphy (surgical fusion of upper and lower eyelid margin to narrow the eyelid opening). \r\n    4. Gluing may be appropriate for focal (\u2018punched-out\u2019) corneal perforations.\r\n-Eyelid surgery: In advanced AKC, extensive scarring of the ocular surface and eyelid margins may necessitate eyelid surgery. This includes lid margin tightening and rotational procedures for lid mal-position, as well as symblepharon lysis and forniceal reconstruction for severe conjunctival scarring.\r\n-Cataract surgery: Many patients will require cataract surgery at a relatively young age due to atopic and steroid-induced cataract development.\r\n-Glaucoma surgery: A few patients may need glaucoma filtering surgery or valve placement if steroid-induced glaucoma develops.\r\n-Stem cell transplantation: Patients who develop limbal stem cell deficiency may require ocular surface stem cell transplantation for visual rehabilitation.\r\n\r\nAssociated systemic conditions should be treated as well. Uncontrolled dermatitis with vision-threatening complications requires systemic steroids.\r\nAny associated Herpes simplex keratitis should be treated with topical antiviral agents. Recurrent attacks of Herpes infection may require systemic antiviral also.\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nAKC remains chronic for years, often persisting into old age, when it may resolve spontaneously.\r\nProper prophylaxis, prompt treatment and planned surgical management can reduce the incidence of poor vision and blindness.\r\nAKC is a potentially blinding disease. AKC may result in diminished vision or blindness from superficial punctate keratitis, persistent corneal epithelial defects, corneal scarring or thinning, cataract, keratoconus and symblepharon formation.\r\nPatients should be observed frequently until the ocular surface disease is stable. Patients being treated with corticosteroids or immuno- suppressives, should have regular examination for drug-induced adverse effects. Corticosteroids promote the development of cataract, glaucoma and may lead to secondary corneal infections."

                "Avian influenza (AI) is an infectious viral disease of birds, commonly known as bird flu. Wild water fowl such as ducks and geese are mostly affected by AI, but often show no apparent signs of illness. Poultry birds are also susceptible to AI infection that can cause large outbreaks and epidemics in poultry.\r\nHumans are not usually affected by AI virus, however some subtypes of AI such as A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), have caused serious infections in people. Other avian influenza subtypes, including H7N3, H7N7, and H9N2, have also infected people.\r\nAvian influenza A(H5N1) subtype virus is highly pathogenic virus. It was first recognized in humans in 1997 during the poultry outbreak in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China. Since its re-emergence in 2003, outbreaks of A (H5N1) have reported from poultry in Asia to Europe, and Africa. According to World Health Organization (WHO), 16 countries have reported 846 laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, including 449 deaths since 2003 through 20 January 2016.Out of 16 countries, 4 were in South-East Asia Region; Bangladesh, Myanmar, Indonesia and Thailand.\r\n10 laboratory-confirmed human cases with avian influenza A (H5N6) virus including 6 deaths have been detected in China since 2013.\r\nIn March 2013, a subtype of influenza virus, A(H7N9) was detected first time in humans in China. A total of 722 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, including at least 286 deaths , have been reported to WHO.\r\nA total of 28 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses, with mild symptoms have been detected globally.\r\nDepartment of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India has reported 25 episodes of AI A(H5N1) in poultry birds in 15 states/ union territory(Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal , Bihar, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura, Sikkim, Odisha, Karnataka, Kerala, Chandigarh) till January 2015. First outbreak of H5N1 occurred in Maharashtra and Gujarat in February 2006. During 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were detected in crows in several states of India.\r\nNo case of avian influenza in humans is detected in India so far. Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme working under National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi is keeping surveillance of avian influenza in India.\r\nInfection of avian populations with certain subtypes of avian influenza A virus poses continuing global public health risks because of two reasons, first- occurrence of sporadic human infections and second- emergence of a pandemic influenza strain (disease occurring over a wide geographic area and affecting an exceptionally high proportion of the population).\r\nAll human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are reportable under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005)."

                "Astigmatism is a type of refractive error wherein the refraction varies in different meridian. As a result, the light rays entering the eye cannot converge to a point focus but form focal lines.\r\nAs described by Bannon and Walsh (1945), astigmatism was first mentioned in 1727 by Sir Issac Newton. But Thomas Young in 1800 published first description of astigmatism.\r\nRefractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye.\r\nEmmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina. The far point in emmetropia (point conjugate to retina in non- accommodating state) is optical infinity, which is 6 meters. Ametropia (refractive error) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.\r\nThe term ametropia (refractive error) describes any condition where light is poorly focused on light sensitive layer of eye, resulting in blurred vision. This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near- sightedness), hypermetropia (far- sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age- related diminution of vision). A person who is able to see without the aid of spectacles or contact lenses is emmetropic.\r\nPrevalence and distribution of ametropia vary greatly with age. Majority of children in early infancy are found to be somewhat hypermetropic. During the school years, children begin to become myopic in increasing numbers. Astigmatism change relatively little with age. The majority of children and young adults have a small amount of with-the-rule astigmatism, but in later adult years, there is a tendency for with-the-rule astigmatism to decrease in amount and for against-the-rule astigmatism to increase.\r\nAstigmatism is divided as\r\n\r\nRegular astigmatism: It is correctable with cylindrical or sphero-cylindrical lenses. It may be\r\n\r\n- With-the-rule astigmatism: When the steepest corneal meridian is close to 90\u02da.\r\n- Against-the-rule astigmatism: When the steepest meridian is close to 180\u02da.\r\n- Oblique astigmatism: Principal meridians do not lie close to 90\u02da or 180\u02da.\r\n- Bi- oblique astigmatism: The two principal meridians are not at right angle to each other.\r\n\r\nIrregular astigmatism: It is not correctable with cylindrical or sphero-cylindrical lenses. Patients with irregular astigmatism typically suffer from reduced visual acuity and poor quality of vision. Irregular astigmatism may result from corneal diseases, such as keratoconus, trauma or scarring following herpes infection. It may also be produced due to cataract surgery, penetrating keratoplasty or elective kerato-refractive surgery.\r\n\r\nDepending on spherical ametropia of a particular eye, astigmatism may be classified as simple or compound based on whether one or both meridians, respectively, are focused outside the retina. If one meridian focuses in front of the retina and the other meridian focuses behind it, the astigmatism is called mixed astigmatism.\r\nIn astigmatism, the eye has different refractive powers along different meridians. Light entering in vertical direction gets focused differently than light in the horizontal direction. The meridian of steeper curvature has greater refractive power. The astigmatic eye produces a blurred image because two focal lines of images are being produced. This requires different corrections along each of these meridians to produce a single focused image on the retina."

Acquired corneal astigmatism is not infrequent, but it often gives rise to irregular astigmatism.\r\nLenticular astigmatism: This is relatively less common. It may be of following types:\r\n\r\n- Curvature astigmatism: Congenital abnormalities of lens curvature may produce small amount of curvature astigmatism. Marked lenticular astigmatism may be seen in condition like lenticonus.\r\n- Positional astigmatism: Congenital tilting or oblique placement of lens may produce small amount of astigmatism. Congenital or traumatic subluxation of lens may also produce astigmatism of varying degrees.\r\n- Index astigmatism: Variable degree of change in refractive index of crystalline lens of patients suffering from diabetes or nuclear sclerosis may occur.\r\n\r\nRetinal astigmatism: Occasionally, obliquity of macula may produce retinal astigmatism.\r\n\r\n\r\nOptics of regular astigmatism:\r\nIn regular astigmatism, the parallel rays of light are not focused at a point but form two focal lines.

Irregular astigmatism shows distorted keratometry.\r\nCorneal topography: Corneal topography is essential in understanding the shape and curvature of cornea, and helps in establishing diagnosis. Irregular astigmatism patients show irregularities on corneal topography.\r\nVery high frequency (VHF) digital ultrasound arc scanner: It is capable of obtaining 3- dimensional (3D) layered pachymetry across the central 10 mm of cornea. Resolution of scanner on cornea mode distinguishes individual corneal layers such as epithelium or stroma in all three dimensions, due to multi-meridional scanning.\r\nWavefront aberrometry: Wavefront aberrometry may help in diagnosis of irregular astigmatism and the assessment of the optical quality of the eye. Simulations of the retinal images are useful to understand some of the symptoms of irregular astigmatism. With corneal topographic analysis, the origin of irregular astigmatism from the cornea or internally, or both, may be specified by aberrometry. Clinical application of aberrometry is wavefront \u2013 guided refractive surgery.\r\n\r\nTypes of regular astigmatism:\r\nBased upon the axis and the angle between two principal meridia, regular astigmatism may be classified into:\r\n\r\nWith-the-rule astigmatism: The two principal meridia are placed at right angle to one another with vertical meridian steeper or more curved than the horizontal one. This is called with-the-rule astigmatism, because similar astigmatic condition exists normally due to eyelid pressure on cornea.\r\nAgainst-the-rule astigmatism: The two principal meridia are placed at right angle to one another with horizontal meridian steeper or more curved than the vertical one.\r\nOblique astigmatism: It is a type of regular astigmatism where two principal meridia, though placed at right angle, are not in vertical and horizontal meridian. Oblique astigmatism is often found to be symmetrical (e.g. cylindrical lens required at 30\u02da in both eyes) or complementary (e.g. cylindrical lens required at 30\u02da in one eye and at 150\u02da in the other eye).\r\nBi-oblique astigmatism: In this type, the two principal meridia are not at right angle to each other.\r\n\r\nRefractive types of regular astigmatism: Depending upon the position of two focal lines in relation to retina, regular astigmatism is classified into:\r\n\r\nSimple astigmatism: The rays of light are focused in one meridian only on the retina. The rays of light in other meridian are focused in front or behind retina. Accordingly, it is called\r\n\r\n- Simple myopic astigmatism: When the light rays of other meridian are focused in front of the retina.\r\n- Simple hypermetropic astigmatism: When the light rays of other meridian are focused behind the retina.\r\n\r\nCompound astigmatism: The rays of light are focused either in front or behind the retina in both the meridia. Accordingly, it is called\r\n\r\n- Compound myopic astigmatism: The rays of light are focused in front of the retina in both the meridia.\r\n- Compound hypermetropic astigmatism: The rays of light are focused behind the retina in both the meridia.\r\n\r\nMixed astigmatism: The rays of light are focused in front in one meridian and behind the retina in other meridian. Thus, eye is myopic in one meridian and it is hypermetropic in other. Such patients have relatively less symptoms as \u2018circle of least diffusion\u2019 forms on retina. It is presumed that a pencil of rays forms a minute circle of clear vision, called circle of least diffusion. Larger is the circle of least diffusion, poorer the vision."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nMedical optical therapy: \r\nOptical therapy of regular astigmatism comprises of prescribing appropriate cylindrical lenses. The cylindrical lenses may be prescribed in the form of\r\n\r\nSpectacles: Regular astigmatism may be corrected with spherocylindrical lenses except where the meridians are not perpendicular. Parallel rays falling upon a cylindrical lens are affected in different ways. In the direction of its axis, it is simply a plane lamina with parallel sides, so that it has no effect on the rays. In the direction at right angles to its axis, it is spherical on one side and plane on the other. Therefore, it acts like a planoconvex or a planoconcave.\r\nContact lenses.\r\n\r\nGuidelines for optical correction:\r\n\r\nSmall astigmatism: Small astigmatism (about 0.5 dioptres or less) may be ignored and corrected only if there are symptoms of eye asthenopia or there is deterioration of vision.\r\nHigh astigmatism: Cylindrical error should be corrected as full as possible. An under correction may be prescribed to begin with if the patient is not comfortable with full correction. In all cases in which astigmatism produces asthenopic symptoms, full optical correction should be prescribed for constant use i.e. for distance as well as for near.\r\nChange in astigmatic correction: Change in astigmatic correction should preferably be avoided even if there is some improvement in visual acuity. Change in astigmatic correction may be given only if there is significant improvement in visual acuity and it may take some time to adjust.\r\n\r\nBi- oblique astigmatism, high astigmatism or mixed astigmatism is better treated by prescribing with contact lenses.\r\nPatients with irregular astigmatism typically suffer from reduced visual acuity as well as visual quality. Pinhole occluders may provide some improvement in vision as compared to spectacles.\r\nOptical therapy of irregular astigmatism consists of prescribing contact lenses which replaces the affected anterior corneal surface for refraction. An improvement in vision may be obtained using gas permeable lenses as compared to soft hydrogel lenses.\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\nIndications of surgery: Correction of astigmatism by surgery is done when it significantly affects vision. Typically, visually significant astigmatism is roughly more than 1 dioptres, although many patients may be symptomatic even with lower astigmatism. With improved surgical techniques such as excimer laser, even lower degree of astigmatism is being treated by surgical means. Usually surgery is done for\r\n\r\nIrregular astigmatism.\r\nPatients who wish to discard glasses or contact lenses.\r\nPatients who are intolerant of glasses or contact lenses.\r\nDevelopment of visually significant astigmatism following ocular surgery.\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy includes:\r\n\r\nLaser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK): Keratomileusis refers to carving of cornea. Astigmatism is corrected by combining central and peripheral treatments to differentially steepen the flattest corneal meridian and flatten the steepest meridian. Excimer laser ablation is applied directly to the corneal stroma after reflecting a lamellar or partial- thickness corneal flap. The flap is returned to its original position, once ablation is complete. Recovery of vision usually takes few days and some patients even take few weeks.\r\nWavefront- guided LASIK: Wavefront- guided LASIK or custom LASIK is a new wavefront technology to program ablation pattern more precisely than the conventional LASIK.\r\nIntraLASIK (IntraLase): IntraLASIK uses femtosecond laser, which is more accurate than a blade and provides a huge margin in terms of precision and safety. Femtosecond laser creates a corneal flap at a pre-programmed depth and position.\r\nEpiLASIK: EpiLASIK is designed to create a thin flap in the epithelium. It is an excellent alternative for patients with thin and steep or flat cornea. The layer is preserved and later replaced following reshaping of cornea using excimer laser.\r\nPhotorefractive keratectomy (PRK): PRK also uses excimer laser to reshape cornea, but this procedure does not require lamellar flap. The laser is applied directly to the anterior stromal surface after removal of surface epithelium. A soft contact lens is prescribed after laser treatment. The corneal epithelium typically heals in about 4 to 7 days. Improvement of vision may take few weeks to several months.\r\nLaser subepithelial keratomileusis (LASEK): It involves cleaving the epithelial sheet at the basement membrane with dilute alcohol, applying laser as in conventional PRK, and repositioning the epithelium afterward.\r\nPhotoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK): Photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy (PARK) has been used to reduce astigmatism.\r\nRadial keratotomy (RK): Earlier RK as keratorefractive surgery was used, that effectively reduced astigmatism. In RK, spoke- like cuts radiating from central cornea at about 90% corneal depth were given to balloon the peripheral cornea. Although RK surgery was effective, the results were often unpredictable and led to overcorrection, with progressive hypermetropia. RK surgery was soon replaced by laser vision correction with the introduction of PRK.\r\nAstigmatic keratotomy (AK): Astigmatic keratotomy is a modification of RK surgery and is used to reduce corneal astigmatism. The two forms of corneal incisions, astigmatic keratotomy and limbal relaxing incisions (LRI), or more accurately peripheral corneal relaxing incisions (PCRI), are differentiated by their location on cornea. In both procedures, incisions are made to about 90% depth in cornea to flatten the steep meridian. PCRIs are easier to perform and have a weaker effect in correction because of their more peripheral location. Relaxing incisions, especially arcuate ones (arcuate keratotomy), are one of the commonly performed procedures for reduction of astigmatism. Femtosecond laser- enabled keratotomy has become an alternative to the mechanical techniques because of higher precision of incisions with improved accuracy and safety.\r\nRefractive lens exchange (RLE): Refractive lens exchange (RLE) is a surgical procedure that may correct refractive error by removing and replacing the clear crystalline lens of the eye with toric intraocular lenses (toric IOLs). RLE is an option for high refractive errors, where laser vision correction is not an option.\r\nPhakic intraocular lens (phakic IOL) implant: Toric phakic intraocular lens (phakic IOL) may be implanted in front of and attached to the iris or is placed just behind the iris. Toric phakic IOL is an alternative to laser vision correction with keratorefractive surgery. Unlike RLE, all eye structures including crystalline lens, is not touched when a toric phakic IOL is implanted.\r\nPenetrating keratoplasty: Penetrating keratoplasty may be required in patients with affected cornea producing irregular astigmatism.\r\n\r\nContraindications to surgery:\r\n\r\nCorneal or anterior segment diseases such as keratitis, conjunctivitis or corneal ulcers."

                "Aphakia is a condition in which crystalline lens of the eye is not present in its normal position of pupillary area. Either there is no crystalline lens inside the eye or the lens is subluxated or luxated. This induces a refractive state which is not a refractive error in true sense. An emmetropic (normal refraction) eye or one having low grade ametropia (refractive error) becomes extremely hypermetropic after cataract surgery. A previously emmetropic eye requires a correction of about 10 to 11 dioptres (D) in spectacle when worn in the usual position.\r\nReplacement of the crystalline lens with a spectacle lens causes the image on patient\u2019s retina to be roughly 25% larger than the image formed with the crystalline lens. The exact magnification is determined by the power of the aphakic spectacles. There is about 2 % of magnification for each dioptre of power in the spectacles.\r\nAphakia comes from two Greek words (a means none and phacos means lens). It refers to both an anatomical and an optical condition.\r\nVon Helmholtz (1855) worked on the optics of aphakia. Benito Daza De Valdes (1623) suggested that aphakia may be corrected with spectacles."

The recorded vision is theoretically better than the actual visual acuity.\r\nBinocular vision: Aniseikonia (unequal size of retinal image) less than 5 %, is compatible with binocular vision. Aniseikonia is harmful to the development of normal binocular function.\r\nDiplopia (double vision): Adult patients who have normal vision in un-operated eye find it difficult to attain binocular single vision and may suffer with diplopia.\r\nSuppression amblyopia: Monocular aphakic children usually develop suppression amblyopia. It may lead to deviation of the operated eye.\r\nAccommodation: Absence of crystalline lens leads to total loss of accommodation. Therefore, a patient needs bifocal, progressive or separate pair of glasses."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nMedical optical therapy:\r\nOptical therapy of aphakia comprises of prescribing appropriate convex lenses. The convex lenses may be prescribed in the form of\r\n\r\nSpectacles: Usually about + 10 D of correction with appropriate cylindrical power for surgically induced astigmatism is prescribed to correct aphakia in previously emmetropic eye. Exact power of glasses required differs in individual cases. Further addition of plus power is required for presbyopia (near vision) to compensate for loss of accommodation. Aphakic spectacles may have glasses in various forms such as aspherical, lenticular or full field lenses. Spectacles causes\r\n\r\n- Magnification of image: The size of the image is magnified by about 25 %. Spectacles produce diplopia in cases of unilateral aphakia. The larger image of an object is interpreted to be closer to the eye. It requires efforts to coordinate between eyes and hand due to magnification. It produces difficulty in climbing stairs as well.\r\n- Prismatic aberrations: It produces roving ring scotoma, usually described as Jack-in-the-box phenomenon. The prismatic effect is produced by the peripheral part of the correcting lens. It produces a ring scotoma. When patient sees an object and turns the eye towards it, the scotoma may shift inwards to occlude the object. On shifting the eye from the object, the scotoma shifts again and the object becomes visible.\r\n- Spherical aberrations: When the objects are viewed through the periphery, the objects look enlarged, proximal, and elongated in radial direction. Pin-cushion effect produces distortion and it is the property of all plus lenses proportional to their diopteric power. This distortion makes a square look like a pincushion- the corners of the square have a stretched out appearance, and the sides are pushed in. The world becomes parabolic which continuously change its shape with eye movement. The objects appear to move faster. Driving a motor vehicle thus becomes very difficult.\r\n- Field of vision: Monocular as well as binocular field of vision is markedly reduced. The actual field of view through the spectacles is reduced by 25 %, which makes it impossible to see that much of peripheral field.\r\n- Coloured vision: There may be coloured hue in the vision. It occurs due to absence of natural filter of a crystalline lens. Removal of the crystalline lens increases blue and ultraviolet transmission of light.\r\n- Thick glasses: The glasses are very thick and heavy. Bifocal glasses are especially difficult to adjust with and may require separate pair.\r\n\r\nContact lenses: Correction of aphakia at the corneal plane requires use of contact lenses. As the position at which the optical correction is made moves closer to retina, the necessary diopteric power increases but the subsequent magnification decreases. A patient who needs 12.5 D in aphakic spectacles would need about 14.7 D in a soft rigid contact lens. At the corneal plane the magnification is 6- 8%. Since the value is near the limit of aniseikonia, most unilateral aphakia patients can have binocular vision. Contact lenses have certain advantages over the glasses such as\r\n\r\n- Provides wider and better field of vision.\r\n- There is less magnification of the image since the contact lenses are close to the cornea.\r\n- More suited for uniocular aphakia.\r\n- It eliminates spherical aberration and prismatic effect.\r\n- It is cosmetically more acceptable.\r\n\r\nHowever, there may be lack of dexterity in older patients and intolerance owing to a foreign body sensation.\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\nSurgical therapy includes\r\n\r\nIntraocular lens (IOL) implantation: IOL implantation is the best method of correcting aphakia. Calculation of power of an IOL depends upon keratometry (measured with keratometer) of the cornea and axial length of the eyeball (measured with ultrasonography). A patient who needs 12.5 D in apahkic spectacles would need about 21 D of an IOL in posterior chamber of eye. The average magnification due to an IOL in posterior chamber is about 1.5%, compared with the original crystalline lens. Almost everyone can achieve binocular vision with one eye pseudophakia and other phakic. An IOL may be implanted at the time of cataract surgery or as secondary implantation at a later date. Advantages of IOL includes\r\n\r\n- Minimal after- care of patients.\r\n- Rapid return of binocular vision.\r\n- Minimal aniseikonia (different image size seen by the eyes).\r\n- Normal peripheral vision.\r\n\r\nRefractive corneal surgery: Corneal onlays, such as epikeratophakia and inlays, such as keratophakia are not used commonly in clinical settings. The optical effects are no different from those of contact lens, but onlays and inlays have the advantage that the patient does not need maintenance. Excellent success of contact lenses and IOLs mean that surgical techniques to correct aphakia at the cornea are not reasonable clinical alternatives. The procedures include\r\n\r\n- Keratophakia: A lenticule obtained from donor cornea is placed in between the lamellar layers of the cornea of the patient.\r\n- Epikeraophakia: A lenticule obtained from donor cornea is stitched over the surface of cornea after removing the epithelium. Epikeraophakia has the advantage that it may be done in patients where, because of age or ocular condition, a secondary or even primary IOL is not feasible. Since the eyeball is not entered, many complications can be avoided. Also, this procedure may be repeated.\r\n- Hypermetropic Laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK).\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nPrognosis for aphakia is generally good, unless there are complications like corneal oedema, cystoid macular oedema or secondary glaucoma.\r\nHowever, aphakia increases the risk of retinal detachment, especially in high myopes and if the posterior capsule is ruptured."

                "Anisometropia is an optical state with unequal refraction of the two eyes. The amount of spherical refractive error (myopia or hypermetropia) is usually about the same for both the eyes in most of the people. Generally, anisometropia is considered to exist if the refraction differs by 1.0 dioptres (D) or more for the two eyes. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. Anisometropia is the most insidious refractive condition because it is often asymptomatic. The term antimetropia is used when one eye is myopic and the other is hypermetropic.\r\nThe word anisometropia is derived from the Greek words anisos (unequal), metron (measure), and ops (vision).\r\nEmmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. Refractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina. The far point in emmetropia (point conjugate to retina in non- accommodating state) is optical infinity, which is 6 meters. Ametropia (refractive error) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays.\r\nThe term ametropia (refractive error) describes any condition where light is poorly focused on light sensitive layer of eye, resulting in blurred vision. This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near-sightedness), hypermetropia (far-sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age-related diminution of vision).\r\nAnisometropia due to refractive myopia or hypermetropia is known as refractive anisometropia and that due to axial ametropia is known as axial anisometropia. Anisometropia due to difference in refractive error along one meridian only is called meridional anisometropia.\r\nIn myopic anisometropia, one expects the distance visual acuity in each eye to be lower than normal, the more myopic eye having the poorer visual acuity. However, when the amount of myopia in the less myopic eye is small (minus 0.25 or 0.50 D), the visual acuity in that eye is sufficiently good so that the patient may not be aware of the problem, even if the visual acuity in the more myopic eye is quite poor.\r\nIn hypermetropic anisometropia, the visual acuity of both eyes is relatively good as long as the patient has sufficient accommodation. \r\nIn myopic anisometropia, hypermetropic anisometropia and antimetropia, the individual may not have complaint of asthenopia (eyestrain) and the anisometropia may be discovered during routine eye examination only. However, some cases of hypermetropic anisometropia may have asthenopia due to their inability to focus simultaneously.\r\nBecause both the eyes accommodate equally, an uncorrected anisometrope has the problem of never having sharply focused image on both retinas at the same time. For example, a person with 0.25 D of myopia in one eye and 3 D of myopia in other eye will have a sharp focus for one eye for objects at a distance of 4 meters and a sharp focus for the other eye for objects at a distance of 33 cm. Due to this, the person uses less myopic eye for distance vision and the more myopic eye for near vision. Although stereopsis (binocular depth perception) is poor, such individuals have an advantage in later years because bifocal reading glasses may not be required.\r\nOn the other hand, a person having 0.25 D of hypermetropia in one eye and 3 D of hypermetropia in the other eye has more severe difficulty. The less hypermetropic eye is used for distance vision requiring 0.25 D of accommodation only. However, more hypermetropic eye requires 3 D of accommodation for distance and 5.50 D of accommodation for a reading distance of 40 cm. Therefore, less hypermetropic eye never has a sharply focused image. It may lead to anisometropic amblyopia (non correctable visual acuity without an obvious cause) in early life."

                "Diagnosis depends upon retinoscopic examination in patients with defective visual acuity.\r\nClinical types of Anisometropia:\r\nAnisometropia may be absolute or relative.\r\nI. Absolute anisometropia: In this condition, refractive power of the two eyes is not equal.\r\nThis is further divided into\r\n\r\nSimple anisometropia: In this type one eye is normal and the other eye is hypermetropic or myopic.\r\nCompound anisometropia: In this both eyes are ametropic i.e. either myopic or hypermetropic.\r\nMixed anisometropia: In this both eyes are ametropic with one being myopic and the other being hypermetropic. This is also called antimetropia.\r\nSimple astigmatic anisometropia: In this type one eye is emmetropic and the other has simple astigmatism either myopic or hypermetropic.\r\nCompound astigmatic anisometropia: Both eyes are astigmatic with unequal degree.\r\n\r\nII. Relative anisometropia: It is that refractive anomaly in which although the total refraction of the two eyes is nearly equal, the component elements in each show relatively large differences. Therefore, total refraction of the two eyes may be equal, but the axial length may be different. This produces clear retinal image with aniseikonia (different size of retinal images).\r\nVisual status in anisometropia: \r\nThere are various visual possibilities\r\n\r\nBinocular single vision: Binocular vision is possible in small degrees of anisometropia. A difference of more than 5 D between two eyes causes loss of binocularity. Since accommodation is distributed equally between two eyes and is not dissociated, the image of one eye is blurred always. It produces symptoms of accommodative asthenopia.\r\nAmblyopia: If visual acuity is not good and the hypermetropia is high, then this eye may be excluded from vision and the eye develops amblyopia. Thus these patients have uniocular vision in the unaffected eye.\r\nAlternating vision: When there is high anisometropia with good visual acuity in eyes, then the patient develops habit of using hypermetropic eye for distance and the myopic eye for near vision. These patients are usually comfortable and do not seek any medical help for vision correction.\r\nStrabismus: The eye with the visual defect become convergent and the child may develop concomitant convergent squint.\r\n\r\nTests for binocular vision:\r\nBinocular vision may be assessed by using FRIEND test or Worth\u2019s four-dot test.\r\nI. FRIEND test: In this test, alternate letters are green and red in colour. Letters F, I and N are in green colour and the letters R, E and D are in red colour. This is available in Snellen\u2019s distance vision chart. Patient is seated 6 meters from the Snellen\u2019s chart and wears diplopia goggles with red glass in front of the right eye and green glass in front of the left eye. Patient then reads letters FRIEND on Snellen\u2019s chart. Result is interpreted as\r\n\r\nPatient reads all letters as FRIEND: In the presence of binocular single vision, the patient reads all letters as FRIEND at once.\r\nPatient reads either green FIN letters or red RED letters: In amblyopia or uniocular vision, patient reads either green letters or red letters i.e. it is read persistently either as FIN (read with left eye) or RED (read with right eye).\r\nPatient reads sometimes FIN and RED: In alternate vision, patient reads sometimes FIN and RED at other times.\r\n\r\nII. Worth\u2019s four-dot test: Patient wears diplopia goggles with red glass in front of the right eye and green glass in front of the left eye. Patient views Snellen\u2019s distance vision chart having four dots of light viz. one red, two green and one white. The results are interpreted as\r\n\r\nPatient sees all the four lights: When all the four lights are seen in the absence of manifest squint, patient has normal binocular single vision. Patient sees four lights also in the presence of a manifest squint with abnormal retinal correspondence.\r\nPatient sees two red lights only: This indicates suppression of vision in the left eye.\r\nPatient sees three green lights only: This indicates suppression of vision in the right eye.\r\nPatient sees three green lights and two red lights alternately: This indicates presence of alternating suppression of vision.\r\nPatient sees three green lights and two red lights (five lights): This indicates the presence of diplopia in patient."

Therefore, reduced optical correction of the more ametropic eye may be required even with compromised visual acuity.\r\nLarge differences in refraction may require contact lenses, and are prescribed if\r\n\r\n- Aniseikonia is present. Contact lenses reduce the difference in the size of the image e. g. as in aphakia. Binocular single vision may be restored in favourable cases.\r\n- There is no improvement of visual acuity in anisometropic amblyopia in children with a difference in refraction of 4 D or above.\r\n- Trial contact lenses show a better binocular function as compared to spectacles.\r\n\r\nPatients with marked anisometropic myopia may show hypophoria in primary position with a head tilt to the side of more myopic eye to maintain a comfortable binocular single vision (the \u2018heavy eye\u2019 phenomenon).\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical therapy includes\r\n\r\nSpectacles: The corrective glasses may be tolerated up to a maximum difference of 4 D in two eyes. A difference more than 4 D produces diplopia. In children younger than 12 years of age, where best visual correction is required in both the eyes, contact lenses are preferred. In adults, best correction may be prescribed which does not result in ocular discomfort.\r\nContact lenses: Contact lenses are advised for higher degrees of anisometropia. These are more useful in young children with high anisometropia, who may become amblyopic in more ametropic eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy\r\nThis is the preferred mode of treatment.\r\nSurgical therapy includes\r\n\r\nIntraocular lens implantation: Intraocular lens may be implanted for uniocular aphakia.\r\nRefractive corneal surgery: Refractive corneal surgery (refractive laser) may be done for unilateral myopia, astigmatism and hypermetropia. Photorefractive surgery, both photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), is being used increasingly to correct anisometropia.\r\nRemoval of crystalline lens: Crystalline lens may be removed for unilateral high myopia.\r\nPhakic IOL: Intraocular lens may be implanted without removing the crystalline lens.\r\nClear lens extraction with the implantation of an IOL: Clear lens extraction with the implantation of an IOL, preferably foldable IOL or a piggyback IOL, may be done. Piggyback IOL means two IOLs are placed in the eye, one on top of the other. This is done if the biometry is +40 D and one does not have a lens of that power to implant."

                "Aniseikonia is defined as a difference in the shape and/or size of images presented to the visual cortex by two eyes. The brain is unable to fuse two images, resulting in an extra ghost image or diplopia. Aniseikonia is often produced due to significant amount of anisometropia, especially when it is corrected by spectacles instead of contact lenses. It is difficult to detect aniseikonia based on history and clinical examination. Aniseikonia precludes fusion of images when the degree is large. Despite this, it is rare that a patient volunteer a difference in image size and/or shape between the two eyes. Aniseikonia is usually considered clinically significant when the image size difference is greater than 4 percent, but many patients experience distortions in spatial perception and/or uncomfortable binocular vision with differences as small as 2 percent.\r\nThe term \u2018aniseikonia\u2019 was introduced by Lancaster in 1938 to refer to a difference between two eyes in the perceived size of an object. The word aniseikonia originates from the Greek words aniso (unequal) and eikon (image).\r\nEmmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. Refractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina. The far point in emmetropia (point conjugate to retina in non- accommodating state) is optical infinity, which is 6 meters. Ametropia (refractive error) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays.\r\nThe term ametropia (refractive error) describes any condition where light is poorly focused on light sensitive layer of eye, resulting in blurred vision. This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near-sightedness), hypermetropia (far-sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age-related diminution of vision).\r\nOptical aniseikonia denotes aniseikonia due to a physically measured difference in the sizes of the retinal images that typically arises in uncorrected axial anisometropia or in corrected refractive anisometropia. Little if any difference in the size of the image occurs with corrected axial anisometropia or with uncorrected refractive anisometropia. Aniseikonia may occur in people for whom the images in the two eyes are equal in size, in which case it must be due to non-optical causes. This condition is referred as neural aniseikonia.\r\nAniseikonia is the cause of curable ocular discomfort suffered by small but not insignificant number of people.\r\nMost commonly aniseikonia occur following eye surgery. An eye with significant refractive error as in aphakia (when operated for cataract) or refractive surgery, the refractive error is minimised in operated eye. But the other eye still requires a strong corrective lens for clear vision. Similarly, when both eyes are operated for cataract surgery but intraocular lens (IOL) with wrong power (pseudophakia) is used in one or both eyes, also produces aniseikonia."

                "Diagnosis depends upon clinical symptoms and retinoscopic examination in patients with defective visual acuity.\r\nClinical aniseikonia may be defined as the amount of aniseikonia that is necessary to correct to eliminate symptoms. It usually occurs when the difference in image size between two eyes approaches 0.75%. The oblique meridional aniseikonia causes a rotational deviation between the fused images of vertical lines in two eyes. This is termed as declination. Declination becomes clinically significant when it approaches 0.3\u02da.\r\nClinical types of aniseikonia\r\nAniseikonia may be either symmetrical or asymmetrical.\r\nSymmetrical aniseikonia\r\nIn symmetrical aniseikonia, one image is larger than the other, either in all dimensions or in one meridian only. This difference in meridian may be oblique.\r\n\r\nOverall aniseikonia: In this type, the size of one ocular image is symmetrically different than the other image. The image may be magnified or minified symmetrically in both meridia.\r\nMeridional or cylindrical aniseikonia: Here the size of retinal image of one eye is symmetrically larger or smaller than that of other in one meridian only. The involved meridian may be vertical, horizontal or oblique.\r\nCompound aniseikonia: There is combination of overall and meridional differences.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsymmetrical aniseikonia\r\nIn asymmetrical aniseikonia, the image is distorted in some degree. This may be\r\n\r\nPrismatic type: In this type, image difference increases progressively in one direction.\r\nPincushion type: In this type, there is progressive increase in all directions from the visual axis, as is seen with high plus correction in aphakia.\r\nBarrel type: In this type, image distortion decreases progressively in both directions, as is seen in correction with high minus lenses.\r\nOblique type: In this type, the size of image is same, but there occurs an oblique distortion of shape.\r\n\r\n\r\nTests for aniseikonia:\r\nAn eikonometer is an instrument used to detect and measure aniseikonia. There are two basic types of eikonometer, the direct eikonometer and the space eikonometer.\r\n\r\nDirect comparison eikonometer: Direct comparison eikonometer presents dichoptic (separate and independent field by each eye) stimuli simultaneously in a stereoscope. The stimuli may be two identical patterns which appear side by side or they may be concentric displays. The difference in size of the two images that appear equal in size indicates the magnitude of anisikonia.\r\nSpace eikonometer: Space eikonometer involves the psychophysical determination of distortions in stereoscopic vision induced by aniseikonia. This method can be used only in subjects with stereoscopic vision.\r\n\r\nClinically, a simple printed direct comparison aniseikonia test and a computerised test is available to analyse aniseikonia."

Anisometropia or difference in the refractive error of the two eyes is the most common cause of aniseikonia. Corrective guidelines are\r\n\r\nAnisometropia should be fully corrected in the presence of amblyopia.\r\nAnisometropia of 3 D or more at one year of age should be corrected as it may produce amblyopia in 60% of cases.\r\nDegree of anisometropia between 1.50 D to 3 D that do not decline on follow-up should also be corrected.\r\nOlder children and adults may not be able to tolerate full correction binocularly. Therefore, reduced optical correction of the more ametropic eye may be required even with compromised visual acuity.\r\nLarge differences in refraction may require contact lenses, and are prescribed if\r\n\r\n- Aniseikonia is present. Contact lenses reduce the difference in the size of the image e. g. as in aphakia.

                "Asbestos-related diseases \r\nAsbestos is a group of naturally occurring fibrous minerals which are commercially used for insulation in buildings and as an ingredient in a number of products such as roofing tiles, water supply lines, and fire blankets, as well as clutches and brake linings, gaskets, and pads for automobiles. Asbestos causes cancer and chronic respiratory diseases in humans.\r\nAll forms of asbestos (chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, tremolite, actinolite and anthophyllite) are in use because of their extraordinary tensile strength, poor heat conduction, and relative resistance to chemical attack. Chemically, asbestos minerals are silicate compounds, meaning they contain atoms of silicon and oxygen in their molecular structure.\r\nAll forms of asbestos are carcinogenic to humans. Exposure to asbestos (including chrysotile) causes cancer of the lung, larynx, and ovaries, and also mesothelioma (a cancer of the pleural and peritoneal linings). Asbestos exposure is also responsible for other diseases such as asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs), and plaques, thickening and effusion in the pleura.\r\nExposure to asbestos occurs through inhalation of fibers in air in the working environment, ambient air in the vicinity of point sources such as factories handling asbestos, or indoor air in housing and buildings containing friable asbestos materials.\r\nAccording to World Health Organization estimates about 125 million people in the world are exposed to asbestos at the workplace. At least 107000 people die each year from asbestos-related lung cancer, mesothelioma and asbestosis resulting from occupational exposures. Approximately half of the deaths from occupational cancer are estimated to be caused by asbestos. In addition, it is estimated that several thousand deaths annually can be attributed to exposure to asbestos in the home.\r\nIt has also been shown that co-exposure to tobacco smoke and asbestos fibers substantially increases the risk for lung cancer and the heavier the smoking, the greater the risk.\r\nAsbestos is still widely used in Asian countries. Asbestos deposits are found in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Rajasthan. In India, the domestic consumption of asbestos is 1.25 lakh tones annually, out of which more than a 1.0 lakh tonnes is being imported. Significant occupational exposure to asbestos occurs mainly in asbestos cement factories, asbestos textile industry and asbestos mining and milling. National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH), Ahmedabad, has carried out environmental and epidemiological studies in cement factories, asbestos textile industry and asbestos mining and milling with the following observations-\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of asbestosis in four cement factories (Ahmadabad, Hyderabad, Coimbatore and Mumbai) varied from 3% to 5%.\r\nIn asbestos textile industry prevalence of asbestosis was 9% in workers having less than 10 years exposure, in contrast to the reported average duration of over 20 years. Exposure to asbestos fibers is quite high in these industries (216-418 fibers/ml as compare to permissible limit of 2 fibers /ml).\r\nThe overall prevalence of asbestosis in mining and milling units was 3% and 21% respectively. In asbestos mines at two locations, the air borne fiber levels were within permissible limits. The average fiber levels in milling units were between 45 fibers/ml -244 fibers/ml.\r\n\r\nThe burden of asbestos-related diseases is still rising, even in countries that banned the use of asbestos in the early 1990s. Because of the long latency periods attached to the asbestos related diseases, stopping the use of asbestos now will result in a decrease in the number of asbestos-related deaths only after a number of decades. There is no safe use of asbestos and no safe limits set by WHO, ILO (International labour organization)."

The mechanism of vision loss is not known, but it is thought to originate in the visual cortex. Amblyopia results in reduced visual acuity, binocularity, depth perception, and contrast sensitivity.

                "A distinction must be made between potentially reversible functional amblyopia and irreversible organic amblyopia. Organic amblyopia is a term used to describe visual impairment due to obvious or non obvious ocular pathology, commonly affecting retina or optic nerve. Examples of organic amblyopia are optic nerve hypoplasia, optic atrophy and foveal hypoplasia. Functional amblyopia may occur along with organic amblyopia. Functional amblyopia normally occurs in an eye that is anatomically normal.\r\nFunctional amblyopia is caused by either form of vision deprivation or abnormal binocular interaction. Form- vision deprivation occurs due to conditions that obstruct the visual axis such as cataract, corneal opacity, vitreous haemorrhage, or severe ptosis, but it may also be produced by severe anisometropia. Abnormal binocular interaction refers to the condition in which the image projected onto the fovea of each eye is dissimilar enough to preclude fusion, thus prompting suppression and ultimately amblyopia of the suppressed eye. While strabismus may be the most obvious cause of abnormal binocular interaction, unilateral opacity of the media and anisometropia may participate in this mechanism as well.\r\nAetiological classification: This is the most commonly used classification and has high prognostic value. It is classified as\r\n\r\nStrabismic amblyopia: Frequently amblyopia is associated with strabismus. Often it may not be known with certainty whether amblyopia is the consequence or the cause of strabismus. Constant tropias (squint) are most commonly associated with amblyopia unlike intermittent tropias (intermittent exotropia). This type of amblyopia is usually unilateral and the severity is not related with the degree of strabismus.\r\nRefractive amblyopia: Ametropia is one of the most important causes of uni- and bilateral amblyopia.\r\n\r\n- Isoametropic amblyopia: This is related to the age. It is said that high refractive errors either bilateral or unilateral would not affect the development of binocularity and visual acuity before the first year of life. Otherwise, refractive errors not corrected after one year of age are related with a high degree of uni- and bilateral decrease of vision.\r\nIn hypermetropia, insufficient accommodative effort which inadequately focuses the images on retina may produce amblyopia. In high myopia, objects close to the patient tend to be in focus and amblyopia is uncommon.\r\n- Anisometropic amblyopia: It is likely to occur because the amount of accommodation necessary to focus the image in the less hypermetropic eye is utilised. Therefore, more hypermetropic eye receives blurred image. When the difference in hypermetropia exceeds two dioptres, amblyopia may be present. Some cases even with less amount of difference may develop amblyopia.\r\nIn anisomyopia, more myopic eye may be used for near vision and the less myopic for distance vision. It causes sharp image to be present in both the eyes. Amblyopia is unusual when myopia does not exceed five dioptres.\r\n- Meridional amblyopia: Meridional amblyopia is due to astigmatism producing defocused images with specific orientation. Astigmatism appears to be an important factor for amblyopia, during first year of life.\r\n\r\nStimulus deprivation amblyopia: This produces most severe amblyopia. Nystagmus usually presents with amblyopia during first three months of life. Ptosis, congenital cataract, corneal opacity and eye occlusion also produces stimulus deprivation amblyopia. Unilateral cases are more amblyogenic. In general, early the treatment, better is the result. Congenital cataract is the leading cause of deprivation amblyopia and need quick diagnosis.\r\nIdiopathic amblyopia: In some patients no amblyogenic factor is detected. It is postulated that this may be due to some amblyogenic factor, such as transient anisometropia in infancy, which might have disappeared with advancing age.\r\nOcclusion amblyopia: Occlusion amblyopia is an iatrogenic condition caused by therapeutic patching of the eye with normal vision. It usually occurs in the sound eye as a result of amblyopia treatment of other eye, but it is occasionally seen in young children after occlusion therapy to treat ocular pathology, such as corneal abrasion."

                "Diagnosis of amblyopia is based mainly on measurement of visual acuity.\r\nA diagnosis of amblyopia requires complete eye examination to rule out any organic cause as well as correct refractive error under cycloplegia. Clinically an organic cause is suspected in addition to functional amblyopia, if treatment improves vision up to certain level only. Amblyopia may be mimicked by any defect in the afferent visual system. Optic nerve glioma is the most important suspected pathology.\r\nVisual acuity measurement \r\nSubjective and objective methods to test visual acuity have been proposed.\r\n\r\nOptical grating: The different stimuli consist of repetitive gratings of predictable and precise luminance variations. Sinusoidal and square- wave gratings are some other forms to test visual acuity.\r\nOptokinetic nystagmus: The primary use of optokinetic nystagmus is a rapid screen for the gross integrity of the visual system. Acuity may be measured as the finest grating that elicits a visible optokinetic nystagmus when different sizes of stripes are used.\r\nPreferential looking test: It is based on the principle that infants tend to fixate a pattern stimulus rather than a homogeneous field. With this, inter-ocular acuity may be detected in children less than one year of age. Acuity is estimated by selecting the spatial frequency of the stripe that was fixed longer than the homogeneous field by 75% of the infants at a given age.\r\nVisually evoked potential: Visually evoked potential is a summed cortical response to changes in some characteristics of a visual stimulus. The visual stimulus may be either a simple flash or a more complex pattern. All these techniques are complementary to evaluate vision in children who are unable to complete recognition acuity tests.\r\nVisuscope: Visuscope is a type of direct ophthalmoscope that projects a focused image onto the retina so that the examiner can see the image on the retina. First the image is projected onto the parafoveal retina, and then the patient is asked to look at the image. Patient with central fixation re-fixates to place the image on fovea again. However, with eccentric fixation, the patient views with the parafoveal retinal area and show a wandering unsteady fixation."

                "Early management of amblyopia is critical for best visual acuity results. The basic strategy for treating amblyopia is to first provide a clear retinal image, and then correct ocular dominance if ocular dominance is present, as early as possible during the period of visual plasticity (birth to eight years of life).\r\nI. Clear retinal image:\r\nPatients with bilateral hypermetropia (&gt; + 5.00 D) should receive the full hypermetropic correction, as amblyopic eyes do not fully accommodate. Patients who are given partial correction of their high hypermetropia often shows very slow or no improvement in their amblyopia. Prescribe full astigmatic correction to provide a clear retinal image.\r\nII. Correct ocular dominance\r\nCorrection of ocular dominance is accomplished by forcing fixation to the amblyopic eye through patching or blurring the vision of the sound eye by\r\n\r\nOcclusion: Patching or occlusion therapy is based on covering the sound eye to stimulate amblyopic eye for vision. Part- time occlusion is preferred because this helps to preserve fusion.\r\nPenalisation: Penalisation is a method for blurring the sound eye to force fixation to the amblyopic eye. Penalisation works if fixation is switched from sound eye to the amblyopic eye.\r\nOcclusive contact lens: Occlusive contact lens may be used to treat amblyopia. This should be used as a last resort since many patients suffer complications of eye.\r\nBilateral light occlusion: A preventive treatment of amblyopia may be the use of bilateral light occlusion. It is shown that this bilateral occlusion prolongs the sensitive period of visual development.\r\nLevodopa/ carbidopa in the treatment of amblyopia: Levodopa is a precursor for the catecholamine dopamine, neuro- transmitter/ modulator known to influence receptive fields.\r\nPleoptics: Pleoptics is a method of treating eccentric fixation associated with dense amblyopia. A bright light temporarily saturates the photoreceptors surrounding the fovea, which eliminates vision from the eccentric fixation point and forces fixation to the fovea.\r\nActive stimulation: Active stimulation of the amblyopic eye as a way to improve vision in the amblyopic eye has been suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis\r\nThe prognosis of amblyopia depends upon the age of the patient, severity of amblyopia, and type of amblyopia. The earlier the amblyopia occurs and longer it remains untreated, the worse is the prognosis. In general, bilateral amblyopia responds better than unilateral amblyopia, and myopic anisometropic amblyopia responds better than hypermetropic anisometropic amblyopia."

The condition is usually congenital but may be acquired. In congenital ankyloblepharon, the fused eyelids fail to separate completely during development of embryo. Congenital ankyloblepharon is caused by developmental arrest leading to aberration in growth at either medial or lateral canthus. It may occur as a sporadic finding or in association with chromosomal/syndromic conditions.\r\nAnkyloblepharon may be complete, partial, or interrupted. In interrupted form, known as ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum (AFA), epithelial bands are present between the lower and upper eyelids. These fine extensile cords attaching lower and upper eyelids may be single or multiple. The cords decrease the palpebral fissure height and reduce excursion of eyelids. It is reported in trisomy 18. In autosomal dominant Hay-Well\u2019s syndrome, ankyloblepharon may be associated with ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip/palate. In partial ankyloblepharon, the horizontal palpebral fissure is shortened.\r\nAnkyloblepharon filiforme adnatum is a form first described by Von Hasner in the year 1881.\r\nAnkyloblepharon may also develop following\r\n\r\nchemical injuries to the eyes.\r\nTrauma.\r\nCicatrising diseases such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or cicatricial ocular pemphigoid.\r\nInflammatory diseases such as herpes simplex infection or ulcerative blepharitis."

                "Diagnosis of ankyloblepharon is based on clinical features.\r\nCongenital ankyloblepharon\r\nThe eyelid margins are usually fused laterally, and less commonly medially. This condition may be associated with other developmental anomalies such as ptosis, microphthalmos, anophthalmos, or cleft lip. Lateral canthal angle may be displaced downward giving an anti-mongoloid appearance to the palpebral fissure. Lateral canthal tendon is lax or not developed so that there is significant laxity of the lower eyelids.\r\nIn ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum, one or more narrow epithelial strands connect the central part of lower and upper eyelid margins. These vary in dimensions from 0.5 mm to 5 mm in width, and may range from 1 mm to 10 mm in length. The zone of attachment lies between the meibomian gland orifices and the eyelashes.\r\nIn total ankyloblepharon, lacrimal secretions may accumulate beneath the eyelids forming a fluid cyst.\r\nAcquired ankyloblepharon\r\nCommonly, acquired ankyloblepharon is due to progressive conjunctival scarring resulting in fusion of the eyelids. Patients usually have a history of progressive scarring related to the primary disease. The eyelids show fusion from scar tissue.\r\n\r\nInvestigations\r\nDetailed ocular examination is performed including measurement of intraocular pressure. Any ocular features of hydrocephalus are noted.\r\nScreening may be required to rule out any genetic disorder associated with ankyloblepharon.\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis\r\nAnkyloblepharon may be differentiated from\r\n\r\nBlepharophimosis: In blepharophimosis, the palpebral aperture is reduced and there is telecanthus (increased medial intercanthus distance), but the eyelid margins are normal.\r\nEuryblepharon: In both euryblepharon and ankyloblepharon, the lateral portion of the eyelid may be lax and displaced downward. In ankyloblepharon, the eyelid margins are fused together for some distance producing a shorter horizontal palpebral fissure.

Normal opening and closing of eyes may also be affected.\r\nManagement of ankyloblepharon is surgical and is indicated for improvement of visual field or for cosmetic reasons.\r\nSurgical therapy\r\nA potential contraindication to ankyloblepharon surgery is the problem of corneal exposure following release of marginal adhesions. This is significant in cases of ankyloblepharon developing after trauma, since other injuries such as damage to fifth and seventh intracranial nerve may be present.

Ankyloblepharon repair may be combined with release of symblepharon adhesion and covering with mucous membrane or amniotic membrane graft.\r\nAcquired ankyloblepharon without symblepharon: In mild cases of acquired ankyloblepharon without symblepharon, separation with blunt scissors may suffice.

AUB is responsible for significant health problem and social embarrassment and it is one of the common reasons women seek health care. It has a significant impact on the quality of life for the women. Women with abnormal bleeding have a lower quality of life than the general female population.\r\nThe normal length of the menstrual cycle is normally between 24 days and 38days. A normal menstrual period generally lasts up to 8days. Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is bleeding from the uterus that is longer than usual or that occurs at an irregular time. (Bleeding during pregnancy has different causes).\r\nAUB leads to loss of productivity and may result in surgical interventions. AUB is reported to occur in 9 to 14% women between menarche and menopause. The prevalence varies in each country. In India, the reported prevalence of AUB is around 17.9%.\r\nThe International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Menstrual Disorders Working Group has proposed to abandon the use of dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB), while continue to use the terms abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) and heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). HMB includes menometrorrhagia (excessive uterine bleeding during menstrual periods and at irregular intervals), metrorrhagia (bleeding at irregular intervals) and polymenorrhoea (more frequent periods). HMB is defined as \u201cexcessive menstrual blood loss which interferes with the woman's physical, emotional, social and material quality of life, and which can occur alone, or in combination with other symptoms.\r\nTo standardize nomenclature of AUB, a new system known by the acronym PLAM-COEIN, was introduced in 2011 by FIGO. The PALM-COEIN system is based on etiology and pathology of disorder, where PALM describing structural causes(polyp; adenomyosis; leiomyoma; malignancy and hyperplasia) and COEIN denoting non- structural causes of AUB (coagulopathy; ovulatory disorders; endometrial factors; iatrogenic; and not classified).\r\nAbnormal uterine bleeding in women of reproductive age is a manifestation of any of a number of pathologic disorders."

These are usually benign but some may be precancerous or cancerous.\r\nAdenomyosis (AUB-A) - This is a condition in which the inner lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows in to the muscle wall of the uterus ( myometrium). It may lead to heavy or longer-than-usual menstrual bleeding, as well as pain during menstrual cycle.\r\nLeiomyoma (AUB-L) - These are benign fibromuscular tumors of the myometrium. Leiomyomas are known by several names, including \u201cmyoma,\u201d and \u201cfibroid.\u201d\r\nMalignancy and hyperplasia (AUB-M) - Malignancy and atypical hyperplasia are associated with, AUB and must be considered in nearly all women of reproductive age.\r\nThe COEIN group is related to non-structural causes of AUB that are not defined by imaging or histopathology. These causes are coagulopathy; ovulatory dysfunction; endometrial; iatrogenic; and not yet classified.\r\nCoagulopathy (AUB-C)-The term \u201ccoagulopathy\u201d includes the systemic disorders of hemostasis that may be associated with AUB. Prevalence and clinical impact of disorders of systemic hemostasis, or coagulopathies(AUB-C) (one of which, von Willebranddisease), can be identified in about 13% of women with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB).\r\nOvulatory dysfunction-Disorders of ovulation may present as different menstrual abnormalities ranging from amenorrhea (absence of periods), extremely light and infrequent bleeding, to unpredictable heavy menstrual bleeding. Ovulatory disorders may be associated with polycystic ovary syndrome, hypothyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, mental stress, obesity, anorexia, weight loss, extreme exercise. Ovulatory disorders frequently occur at the extremes of reproductive age: adolescence and the perimenopause. As women approach menopause, cycles shorten and often become intermittently anovulatory.\r\nEndometrial (AUB-E) \u2013 When uterine bleedingoccurs due of the abnormalities of endometrium with normal ovulatoryfunction, and without any coagulopathy it is known as AUB-E.\r\nIatrogenic (AUB-I)-Abnormal uterine bleeding associated with the use of exogenous gonadal steroids, intrauterine devices, or other systemic or local agents is classified as iatrogenic (AUB-I).\r\nNot yet classified (AUB-N) - A category of \u201cnot yet classified\u201d was created to accommodate entities that are rarely encountered or are ill-defined."

                "The ultimate goal of any form of treatment is to reduce menstrual flow in order to improve quality of life. The two main objectives of managing acute AUB are:\r\n1) To control the current episode of heavy bleeding and\r\n2) To reduce menstrual blood loss in subsequent cycles.\r\nMedical therapy is considered the preferred initial treatment. Conservative and uterine-preserving treatment options are used initially; however, ineffective medical treatment and certain situations need prompt surgical management.\r\nOnce the acute episode of bleeding has been controlled, medical therapy can be started as long term treatment. In medical therapy multiple treatment options are available include levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), oral contraceptives in monthly or extended cycles (OCs), progestin therapy (oral or intramuscular), tranexamic acid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists.\r\nSurgery- When AUB does not respond to medical therapy, a surgical procedure is required to control the bleeding. Surgical treatment is based on the clinical diagnosis, the severity of bleeding, contraindications and response to medical management, the underlying medical condition, age and fertility status of women (whether she wants to have children).\r\n\r\nHysteroscopic surgical removal of polyp- Polyps that cause AUB can be removed for controlling symptoms and even asymptomatic polyps need to be removed to exclude the chances of cancer.\r\nEndometrial ablation destroys the lining of the uterus. It stops or reduces the total amount of bleeding.\r\nUterine artery embolization is a procedure used to treat fibroids. This procedure blocks the blood vessels to the uterus, which in turn stops the blood flow that fibroids need to grow.\r\nDilation and curettage with concomitant hysteroscopy may be of value for those patients in whom intrauterine pathology is suspected or a tissue sample is required.\r\nMyomectomy is done to remove the fibroids.\r\nHysterectomy- Hysterectomy is defined as the surgical removal of the uterus. It is one of the most common of all surgical procedures and can also include the removal of the fallopian tubes, ovaries and cervix. Depending on the size, mobility of the uterus, the location of uterine fibroids, size and shape of the vagina, hysterectomy can be performed in different ways such as abdominal hysterectomy (AH), vaginal hysterectomy (VH) and laparoscopic hysterectomy.\r\n\r\nHysterectomy should not be used as a first-line treatment solely for HMB. Hysterectomy should be considered only when other treatment options have failed or are contraindicated or are declined by the woman. A woman with AUB/HMB should have adequate time and support from healthcare professionals in the decision-making process."

                "Anaemia during pregnancy is one of the important factors associated with a number of maternal and foetal complications. It decreases the woman\u2019s reserve to tolerate bleeding either during or after child birth and makes prone to infections. Anaemia during pregnancy also has been associated with increased risk of intra uterine growth restriction, premature delivery, low birth weight (LBW) and maternal and child mortality.\r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO)/World Health Statistics data shows that 40.1% of pregnant women worldwide were anemic in 2016. The condition is prominent in Southeast Asian countries where about half of all global maternal deaths are due to anemia and India contributes to about 80% of the maternal death due to anaemia in South Asia. There is marginally decrease in prevalence of anemia in pregnant women in India from 58% in NFHS-3 (National Family Health Survey-2005-06) to 50 % in NFHS-4 survey (2015-16).\r\nAmong the various causes of anaemia in women, iron deficiency is the most common cause, primarily due to their recurrent menstrual loss and secondary due to poor supply of iron in the diet. During pregnancy anemia is common due to increased demand of iron for the growing fetus and placenta; and increased red blood cell mass (with expanded maternal blood volume in the third trimester), which is further aggravated with other factors such as childbearing at an early age, repeated pregnancies, short intervals between pregnancies and poor access to antenatal care and supplementation. Indian Council of Medical Research considers haemoglobin (Hb) level below 10.9 g/dl as cutoff point for anemia during pregnancy.\r\nThe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has given emphasis to prevent anaemia under RMNCH+A services. National Health Policy 2017 also addressed malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies interventions. \u201cNational Iron Plus Initiative\u201d launched in 2013 is a comprehensive strategy to combat the public health challenge of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) prevalent across the life cycle.\r\nNational Nutrition Mission has been setup under the oversight of the Ministry of Women and Child Development with the aim to reduce anaemia among young children, adolescent girls and women of reproductive age (15\u201349 years) by one third of NFHS-4 levels by 2022."

                "The common causes of anemia during pregnancy are nutritional disorders and infections. Among nutritional disorders iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia globally. Other conditions such as folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin A deficiency, chronic inflammation, parasitic infections, and inherited disorders can all cause anemia.\r\nCauses of nutritional anaemia in women: \r\n\r\nInsufficient quantity of iron-rich foods and, and low bioavailability of dietary iron (non-haem iron from plant sources)\r\nLess quantity of iron enhancers (foods rich in vitamin C such as citrus fruits) in the diet\r\nExcessive quantity of iron inhibitors in diet, especially during mealtimes (such as tea, coffee; calcium-rich foods)\r\nIron loss during menstruation\r\nPoor iron stores from infancy, childhood deficiencies and adolescent anaemia\r\nIron loss from post-partum haemorrhage\r\nIncreased iron requirement during pregnancy\r\nTeenage pregnancy\r\nRepeated pregnancies with less than 2 years\u2019 interval\r\nIron loss due to parasite load (e.g., malaria, intestinal worms)\r\nPoor environmental sanitation and unsafe drinking water\r\n\r\nIron deficiency anaemia (IDA): Among women, iron deficiency prevalence is higher than among men due to menstrual iron losses and the extreme iron demands of a growing foetus during pregnancies, which are approximately two times the demands in the non-pregnant state. There is substantial increase in iron requirement during pregnancy that ranges from 0.8mg per day in the first trimester to 7.5mg per day in the third trimester.\r\nIDA occurs when the body doesn\u2019t have enough iron to produce adequate amounts of haemoglobin. Low bio-availability of iron in food, inadequate intake of iron rich food and iron enhancers, and excess consumption of iron inhibitors can contribute to iron deficiency anemia.\r\nFolate deficiency anaemia- Folate is a type of B vitamin needs to produce new cells including healthy red blood cells. During pregnancy, women need extra folate and when they don\u2019t get enough from diet, it results in to anemia. Folate deficiency can directly contribute to certain types of birth defects such as neural tube abnormalities (spina bifida). A diet low in fresh fruits, vegetables, and fortified cereals is the main cause of folate deficiency.\r\nVitamin B12 deficiency can also lead to anaemia during pregnancy which may contribute to birth defects such as neural tube abnormalities, and could lead to preterm labor. Folate deficiency and vitamin B-12 deficiency can often be found together.\r\nHelminthic infestation (such as hookworm) is associated with IDA due to chronic intestinal blood loss.\r\nMalaria causes anaemia by rupturing RBCs and suppressing production of RBCs. Malaria in pregnancy increases the risk of maternal anaemia, stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, LBW and neonatal deaths.\r\nSickle cell disease and thalassemia are inherited disorders of haemoglobin result in recurrent haemolytic anaemia.\r\nInfections: Certain chronic diseases, such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease and other chronic inflammatory diseases can interfere with the production of RBCs, resulting in chronic anaemia. Kidney failure can also cause anaemia\r\nIn developing countries early onset of childbearing, high number of births, short intervals between births, and poor access to antenatal care and iron supplementation also contribute to occurrence of anemia during pregnancy."

                "The causes of APH include: placenta praevia, placental abruption and local causes (such as bleeding from the vulva, vagina or cervix). Abruption is more likely to be related to conditions occurring during pregnancy and placenta praevia is more likely to be related to conditions existing prior to pregnancy.\r\nPlacenta praevia is defined as a placenta that lies wholly or partly within the lower uterine segment. It occurs in .4%-.8 % of pregnancies. The condition is mostly diagnosed on ultrasound examination.\r\nClassification of placenta previa (Williams)\r\n\r\nTotal placenta previa: Internal cervical os is covered completely by placenta.\r\nPartial placenta previa: Internal cervical os is partially covered by placenta.\r\nMarginal placenta previa: The placenta is implanted in the lower segment such that the placental edge does not actually reach the internal cervical os but is in close proximity of it.\r\n\r\nFactors associated with the development of placenta praevia include:\r\n\r\nincreasing maternal parity,\r\nadvancing maternal age,\r\nincreasing placental size (multiple pregnancy),\r\nendometrial damage (previous dilatation and curettage), endometritis\r\nprevious caesarean section, uterine scars and pathology\r\nprevious myomectomy\r\nplacental abnormalities,\r\nprevious placental praevia, and\r\ncigarette smoking.\r\n\r\nPlacental abruption/ abruptio placentae \u2013Placental abruption is the premature separation of a normally situated placenta from the uterine wall, resulting in haemorrhage before the delivery of the foetus. In placental abruption some of the bleeding escapes through the cervix causing external haemorrhage and sometimes bleeding is concealed when blood does not escape externally. Placental abruption can occur in up to 5% of pregnancies.\r\nThe precise cause of abruption is unknown, but risk factors for placental abruption include: pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, non-vertex presentations, polyhydramnios, advanced maternal age, multiparty, low body mass index (BMI), pregnancy following assisted reproductive techniques, intrauterine infection, premature rupture of membranes, abdominal trauma (both accidental and resulting from domestic violence), smoking, drug misuse (cocaine and amphetamines) during pregnancy and maternal thrombophilia. Bleeding in first trimester also increases the risk of abruption later in the pregnancy.\r\nPlacental abruption is mostly diagnosed on ultrasound examination. Though Sonography is not sensitive for the detection of placental abruption but it is highly specific.\r\nPlacenta accrete- When the placenta (or part of the Placenta) invades and is inseparable from the uterine wall, it is called placenta accrete. It can cause bleeding during the third trimester and severe blood loss during delivery.\r\nOther causes-In a small proportion of cases cervicitis, trauma, vulval varicosities (varicoseveins at the outer surface of the female genitalia -vulva), genital tumours, genital infections and vasa previa may be the cause of APH. Many of these conditions are evident on the initial speculum examination."

                "Diagnosis of antepartum hemorrhage is first based on clinical suspicion. Initially clinical assessment of women presenting with APH is done by medical person to establish urgency of intervention required to manage maternal or fetal compromise.\r\nIf there is no maternal compromise a full history should be taken. It includes history taking to assess coexisting symptoms such as pain, an assessment of the extent of vaginal bleeding, the cardiovascular condition of the mother, and an assessment of fetal wellbeing.\r\nIn placenta previa, uterus is felt to be relaxed on palpation and non-tender. Generally presenting part is high up and floating.\r\nIn placental abruption, the triad of sudden onset of abdominal pain, bleeding per vagina, tense and tender uterus constitutes the main diagnostic criteria.\r\nSpeculum examination- A speculum examination can be useful to identify cervical dilatation or can visualise a lower genital tract cause for the APH.\r\nIf placenta praevia is a possible diagnosis (for example, a previous scan shows a low placenta, or there is a high presenting part on abdominal examination, or the bleeding is painless), digital vaginal examination should not be performed until an ultrasound has excluded placenta praevia.\r\nIf APH is associated with pain or uterine activity digital vaginal examination can provide information on cervical dilatation.\r\nBlood tests-\r\n\u00b7Full blood count with haemoglobin estimation\r\n\u00b7Blood grouping with Rh factor\r\n\u00b7Screening for coagulation factor\r\n\u00b7Liver function tests\r\n\u00b7Urea and electrolyte test\r\nUltrasound scan (USG)-\r\nWomen presenting with APH should have an ultrasound scan performed to confirm or exclude placenta praevia, if the placental site is not already known. Transvaginal ultrasound is more accurate than transabdominal in diagnosing placenta previa.\r\nThe sensitivity of ultrasound for the detection of retroplacental clot (abruption) is poor. However, when the ultrasound suggests an abruption, the likelihood that there is an abruption is high.\r\nTransvaginal ultrasound (an ultrasound view of the cervix) in combination with color Doppler (which can show blood flowing through veins) is the most effective tool in the diagnosis of vasa previa during pregnancy and can be utilized in patients at risk.\r\nMRI is used only to differentiate different degrees of myometrial invasion."

                "Diagnosis depends upon clinical history and examination.\r\nPatients present with sudden monocular loss of vision that usually is less than fifteen minutes, and it rarely exceeds thirty minutes. Vision loss may be complete or partial. It is described as a curtain falling down in front of the eye or as a generalised darkening. Patient may experience one to multiple episodes, which usually resolve spontaneously. The attacks may sometimes be associated with ipsilateral cerebral TIA, with contralateral neurological features.\r\nSome patients may present with emboli such as cholesterol plaques, which may result in retinal ischaemia. Depending upon the severity of ischaemia, BRA or CRA occlusion may develop.\r\nOther group of patients, mainly with ocular ischaemic syndrome, ipsilateral internal carotid artery occlusion produces hypoperfusion to retinal photoreceptors with resultant blurring or diminution of vision. Patients with ocular ischaemic syndrome present with transient blurring of vision. Vision deteriorates with progression of disease. Episcleral vessels may show congestion and there may be mild anterior chamber inflammation. Fundus examination usually shows dilated and tortuous retinal veins with narrowed arterioles and dot/blot haemorrhages. Persistent hypoperfusion may lead to development of neovascularisation in iris, angle of anterior chamber, optic disc, and retina.\r\nThe visual loss from migraine may last from few seconds to an hour. It is preceded by a scintillating scotoma, or is precipitated by exercise or rise in body temperature (Uhthoff sign).\r\nPatients with giant cell arteritis may show palpable hard arteries or tenderness of scalp.\r\n\r\nInvestigations\r\nBesides general examination, following investigations may help in assessment of vessels.\r\n\r\nDoppler test: Doppler of carotid vessels may help in assessment of vessels.\r\nMagnetic resonance imaging: It may help in assessment of vascular patency.\r\nComputed tomography: Vascular patency may also be assessed by computed tomography.\r\nElectrocardiogram/ Holter monitoring: This helps to localise any cardiac arrhythmia or any possible source of cardiac emboli.\r\nNeuroimaging: It may be done to rule out any other cause of vision loss.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis\r\nBesides CRA/CRV occlusion, monocular vision loss may be due to conditions such as\r\n\r\nPapilloedema\r\nMultiple sclerosis\r\nSickle cell anaemia\r\nEpilepsy"

This nerve has the longest intracranial course amongst all the cranial nerves. A palsy affecting this nerve alone is less common. Usually, seventh (CN VII or facial) and eighth (CN VIII or vestibulocochlear) cranial nerves are also affected along with it, which signals a central cause.\r\nChildren are more likely to be affected by a tumour, and older people are more likely to have vasculopathy producing ischaemia.\r\nCN VI palsy may present with \u2018false localising sign\u2019, suggesting impingement, when in fact, the causative reason/tumour may be remotely present, or there may not be any detectable reason/tumour. Similarly, raised intracranial pressure may stretch CN VI, and perhaps compression of its vascular supply.\r\nThe sixth cranial nerve is the most commonly affected motor nerve to the eye in adults."

Patients presenting with partial or mild palsy adopt posture with head turn toward the affected side to minimise diplopia by keeping the affected eye adducted (inward movement). Severe cases may shut the eye or cover it to avoid diplopia.\r\nPresentation depends upon the aetiology.\r\nCongenital CN VI palsy may present with congenital esotropia reported to occur about six to eight weeks of life. Most cases without peripheral misdirection of nerves are transient and probably are due to perinatal trauma. There are two types of transient CN VI palsy:\r\n\r\nNeonatal esotropia with an obvious unilateral abduction deficit\r\nNeonatal esotropia with no obvious unilateral abduction deficit.\r\n\r\nAcquired CN VI palsy may be due to varied aetiology:\r\nBenign recurrent CN VI palsy in children may occur after benign acute viral sickness or immunisation. This is an isolated condition with acute onset, and is associated with restriction of abduction.\r\nPatients with vasculopathy present with sudden onset, painless horizontal diplopia. These patients typically show spontaneous and complete resolution within three to six months.\r\nPatients with raised intracranial pressure (ICP) may present with unilateral or bilateral symptoms of headache, visual obscuration, or profound loss of vision.\r\nIntracavernous carotid artery dissection or aneurysm may produce painful CN VI palsy along with ipsilateral Horner syndrome.\r\nPainful CN VI palsy may be present in mastoiditis and petrositis complicating chronic otitis media. A tumour in this region may produce a combined trigeminal-abducens-facial nerve syndrome.\r\nCN VI palsy may be associated with involvement of seventh or eighth cranial nerves.\r\nIn unilateral CN VI, four to sixteen prism dioptres of hyperdeviation may be present due to vertical strabismus in children such as dissociated vertical deviation, superior oblique palsy, or physiological hyperphoria.\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis\r\n\r\nDuane syndrome: Duane syndrome, a congenital condition due to misdirected third cranial nerve innervation of lateral rectus, may simulate CN VI palsy.\r\nM\u00f6bius syndrome: M\u00f6bius syndrome is a congenital bilateral CN VI nerve palsy along with seventh cranial nerve palsy.\r\nWernicke encephalopathy: Wernicke encephalopathy resulting from thiamine depletion may produce features of inability to abduct eyes like bilateral CN VI palsy.\r\nMyasthenia gravis: Clinical features and tests may distinguish Myasthenia gravis, from CN VI palsy.\r\nTraumatic fracture of medial orbital wall with medial rectus entrapment: Traumatic fracture of medial orbital wall with medial rectus entrapment may produce restrictive esotropia.\r\nDysthyroid ophthalmopathy: Dysthyroid ophthalmopathy, mainly affecting medial rectus muscle may also produce restrictive esotropia.\r\nOrbital tumour: Orbital tumour may also produce restrictive esotropia."

The most important symptom is painless progressive blurring of vision.\r\nRefractive errors occur when the rays of light entering the eye do not focus onto the retina, the part of the eye on which the image forms. This is a very important cause of poor vision in children.\r\nGlaucoma occurs when the pressure of the eye is increased and that causes progressive loss of sight. It is very important to identify and treat glaucoma as the vision lost is irreversible.\r\nIn corneal opacities the clear part of the eye in the front through which the light enters the eye becomes opaque and the patient cannot see.\r\nThe type of partial vision loss may differ, depending on the cause:\r\n\r\nWith cataracts, vision may be cloudy or fuzzy, and bright light may cause glare.\r\nWith diabetes, vision may be blurred, there may be shadows or missing areas of vision and difficulty seeing at night.\r\nWith glaucoma, there may be tunnel vision and missing areas of vision.\r\nWith macular degeneration, the peripheral (side) vision is normal but the central vision is slowly lost."

Person will be asked to press a button every time you see a light. This shows any gaps in his field of vision.\r\nTest for visual acuity\r\nA Snellen chart is used to measure visual acuity. It involves reading letters off a chart on which the letters become progressively smaller. This chart is used during a routine eye test.After the test, a score made up of two numbers is given. The first number represents how far away from the chart were able to successfully read the letters on the chart. The second number represents how far away a person with healthy vision should be able to read the chart.\r\nSo if you were given a visual acuity score of 6/60, it means you can only read 6 meters away what a person with healthy eyesight can read 60 meters away. The normal eyesight is 6/6.\r\nPartial sight impairment\r\nPartial sight, or sight impairment, is usually defined as:\r\n\r\nHaving very poor visual acuity (3/60 to 6/60) but having a full field of vision\r\nHaving a combination of moderate visual acuity (up to 6/24) and a reduced field of vision or having blurriness or cloudiness in your central vision\r\nHaving relatively good visual acuity (up to 6/18) but a lot of your field of vision is missing\r\n\r\nSevere sight impairment (blindness)\r\nThe legal definition of severe sight impairment (blindness) is when 'a person is so blind that they cannot do any work for which eyesight is essential'.\r\nThis usually falls into one of three categories:\r\n\r\nHaving extremely poor visual acuity (less than 3/60) but having a full field of vision\r\nHaving poor visual acuity (between 3/60 and 6/60) and a severe reduction in your field of vision\r\nHaving average visual acuity (6/60 or better) and an extremely reduced field of vision"

It has been seen that breast cancer is most common in the women over 50 who have been through menopause.\r\nLevels of estrogen: When the body is exposed to high levels of estrogen. This may happen due to early start of periods and late menopause. Also not having children or having children at later age may also increase the risk of developing breast cancer as body is exposure to estrogen is uninterrupted by pregnancy.\r\nFamily history: If there is a history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer in the family, there may be higher risk of developing breast cancer. Particular genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, can increase the risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer. It is possible for these genes to be passed on from a parent to their child. Third gene (TP53) is also associated with increased risk of breast cancer.\r\nAlcohol: The risk of developing breast cancer is also associated with the amount of alcohol one drinks.\r\nSmoking: The risk of smoking is associated with breast cancer\r\nRadiation: Certain medical procedures that use radiation, such as X-rays and CT scans, may slightly increase risk of developing breast cancer."

                "Brain tumour is an abnormal or uncontrolled growth of cells found in the brain. In a healthy human body, normal cells grow old or die and new cells take their place. Sometimes, this process goes wrong. Some unnecessary new cells are produced when the body doesn't need them, and old or damaged cells don't die as they should. The formation of these extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumour. There are two main types of tumours which are called benign tumours (harmless growth) and malignant (cancerous tumours).\r\nBrain tumour is a deadly disease. However, it can be treated by various methods but majority of patients die within 9-12 months and less than 3% survive more than 3 years.\r\nCancerous tumours can be divided into primary brain tumours that start within the brain, and secondary brain tumours that originate from somewhere else, but spread throughout the body, known as brain metastasis tumours.\r\nThere are many types of primary brain tumours. They are named according to the type of cells or the part of the brain in which they are found or begin. For example, if the brain tumour begins in glial cells it is called glioma. Similarly there are other types depending upon the part of brain in which the tumour originates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Facts about Brain tumour\r\n\r\nBrain tumour can occur at any age.\r\nThe exact cause of brain tumour is not clear.\r\nGenetic factors play an important role .The role of radiation hazard is not yet established.\r\nThe symptoms of brain tumour depend on their size, type, and location.\r\nThe most common type of primary brain tumour among adults are astrocytoma, meningioma, and oligodendroglioma.\r\nThe most common type of primary brain tumours in children are medulloblastoma, grade I or II astrocytoma (or glioma), ependymoma, and brain stem glioma.\r\nBrain tumours are diagnosed , based on medical history, physical examination and various specialised Tests.\r\nOptions for brain tumour treatment include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or a combination thereof."

                "Diagnosis of BEB is made clinically (based on history and physical examination) and it is a diagnosis of exclusion by ruling out the presence of associated conditions.\r\nClinical features:\r\nBenign Essential Blepharospasm:\r\nAt onset of BEB, there is increased frequency of blinking precipitated by stimuli such as wind, sunlight, noise, air pollution, reading, watching television, stress, or movement of eye or head. Patients may develop sensory tricks (\u2018geste antagoniste\u2019) to relieve symptoms such as tics and movements of other muscles innervated by facial nerve e.g. whistling, coughing, eating, picking teeth, yawning or chewing gum.\r\nEyelid spasm, a characteristic feature of blepharospasm, sets in a few months to years after early features. Blepharospasm is unilateral to begin with but usually eventually evolves into a bilateral condition. Blepharospasm usually lasts for minutes to hours together. Blepharospasm has a variable course and may be intermittent or continuous. It is slowly progressive in most of the patients.\r\nExcessive blinking may lead to unilateral mild twitches, but may progress to bilateral, frequent and forceful spasms. During severe episodes, patient is unable to open the eyelids which may be associated with severe pain and functional blindness and may interfere with daily routine activities. Severe blepharospasm may cause high level of distress and psychosocial impairment causing anxiety, depression, avoidance of social contact and occupational problems. Blepharospasm reduces while concentrating on a specific task or during sleep.\r\nBlepharospasm may be associated with apraxia (loss of ability to perform activity) of eyelid opening i.e. inhibition of proper functioning of levator palpebrae superioris muscle. Apraxia is especially common in parkinsonian disorders.\r\nSecondary blepharospasm: \r\n\r\nMeige\u2019s syndrome: Meige\u2019s syndrome may be associated with facial grimacing due to facial dystonia.\r\nBreughel\u2019s syndrome: Breughel\u2019s syndrome is a dystonia of motor trigeminal nerve which produces widely open mouth. There is paroxysmal hyperpnoea (increased depth of breathing) and upbeating nystagmus.\r\nExtrapyramidal disorders: Patients with extrapyramidal disorders may show other abnormal movements such as tics or cogwheel rigidity of neck and extremities.\r\nReflex blepharospasm: Reflex blepharospasm may occur due to dry eye or ocular irritation from light.\r\n\r\n\r\nConditions relieving blepharospasm:\r\nThese include:-\r\n\r\nSleep.\r\nRelaxation.\r\nInferior gaze.\r\nArtificial tears.\r\nTraction on eyelids.\r\nTalking.\r\nSinging.\r\nHumming.\r\nSolving crossword.\r\nDoing maths.\r\nSolving puzzles.\r\n\r\nAnatomic changes associated with long-standing blepharospasm may be:\r\n\r\nPtosis (drooping of upper eyelid in relation to eyeball): Ptosis of the upper eyelid may occur due to attenuation and disinsertion of levator palpebrae superioris aponeurosis (broad sheetlike tendon).\r\nEyebrow ptosis (drooping): Eyebrow ptosis may result from weakened fascial support caused by longstanding spasm, leading to stretching of fascia.\r\nDermatochalasis: Dermatochalasis is defined as excess of skin in eyelid and is produced by stretching of skin due to blepharospasm.\r\nSkin excoriation: Skin excoriation is produced secondary to manual attempts by patient to open lids.\r\nEntropion: Blepharospasm may lead to spastic entropion.\r\nCanthal tendon abnormalities: Stretching of medial and lateral canthal tendons may produce horizontal lid laxity and therefore, may cause entropion or ectropion of lower lids. Stretching may produce lid fissures also.\r\nPhimosis (short and narrow) of palpebral fissure (opening between eyelids): Bepharospasm may lead to phimosis of palpebral fissure.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlepharospasm may be differentiated from conditions like:\r\n\r\nOcular myokymia: Ocular myokymia is characterised by spontaneous, fine fascicular contractions of orbicularis oculi muscle without muscular weakness or atrophy. Eyelid myokymia is typically unilateral and it commonly involves lower eyelids.\r\nSecondary to meningeal irritation.\r\nFacial tics or Tourette syndrome: Facial tics are repetitive stereotyped movements or vocalisations such as blinking, sniffing, facial movements or tensing of abdominal muscles.\r\nHemifacial spasms (contraction of one side of face): It usually begins as fasciculations of periocular orbicularis and surrounding muscles, which spreads to involve lower facial muscles innervated by facial nerve. Spasms are myoclonic, involuntary, aggravated by stress and may persist during sleep. Hemifacial spasm may lead to facial weakness.\r\nFocal seizures."

It is postulated that a decrease in local lysozyme and immunoglobulin levels with tear deficiency may alter resistance to bacteria, thereby predisposing to staphylococcal blepharitis.\r\n\r\nSome patients with seborrhoeic blepharitis and MGD also develop dry eye. This may result from increased tear evaporation due to deficiency in the superficial lipid layer of tears as well as reduced ocular surface sensation.\r\n- Acne rosacea.\r\n- Seborrhoeic dermatitis.\r\n- Parasitic infestations, such as Demodex folliculorum (causes Demodicosis) and Phthiriasis palpebrarum.\r\n\r\nDemodex infestation, characterised by cylindrical dandruff like sleeves around eyelashes may be found in patients with chronic blepharitis. Its role is not firmly established since Demodex can be found with nearly same prevalence in asymptomatic patients. However, patients with recalcitrant blepharitis have responded to therapy directed against Demodex mites.\r\n- Herpes simplex dermatitis.\r\n- Varicella-zoster dermatitis.\r\n- Molluscum contagiosum.\r\n- Allergic or contact dermatitis.\r\n\r\nSj\u00f6gren syndrome may present as blepharitis.\r\nThe exact pathogenesis of blepharitis is not known and is suspected to be multi-factorial.\r\nStaphylococcal blepharitis:\r\nThe mechanism by which bacteria Staphylococcus aureus cause symptoms of blepharitis is not known. There may be direct irritation from staphylococcal toxins and/or enhanced cell-mediated immunity to bacteria.\r\nSeborrhoeic blepharitis:\r\nSeborrhoeic blepharitis has less inflammation than staphylococcal blepharitis but has more oily or greasy scaling. Some patients of seborrhoeic blepharitis also show meibomian gland dysfunction.\r\nMeibomian gland dysfunction (MGD):\r\nMeibomian gland dysfunction shows abnormalities and altered secretion of meibomian glands.

Eye is examined under cobalt blue filter. After an interval, appearance of black spot or lines, indicate formation of dry areas. Formation of dry area at same spot shows local corneal abnormality and is ignored. A BUT of less than 10 seconds suggests tear film instability.\r\n\r\nAnterior blepharitis:\r\nAnterior blepharitis involves mainly eyelashes and associated oil glands. Various formations of debris adhere to lashes such as:-\r\n- Crusting: Crusting refers to flakes of material that adhere to the lashes and usually represents seborrhoeic disease. Seborrhoeic blepharitis primarily involves anterior lid and is associated with formation of greasy crusts adherent to eyelash.\r\n- Collarette: Collarette is an irregular ring like formation around the base of eyelashes and is seen in staphylococcal blepharitis.\r\n- Sleeve: Sleeve is a smooth tube of material that also surrounds the base of eyelash as seen in Demodex infestation.\r\n- Ulcers: Ulcers form at the base of eyelash. These are covered by a crust of fibrin, which is lifted up with the growth of eyelash shaft.\r\n\r\nCorneal disease is most common with staphylococcal blepharitis.\r\nPosterior blepharitis:\r\nPosterior blepharitis causes alterations in secretory metabolism and function of meibomian glands. Meibomian secretions become wax like causing blockage of gland orifices. Stagnant material causes growth of bacteria and leads to inflammation.\r\n- Meibomian seborrhoea: Meibomian seborrhoea is characterised by dilated meibomian glands which produce copious amounts of lipids. This appears on lid margins as small oil globules or as collection of waxy material. Tear film is excessively oily and foamy. In severe cases, secretions collect as a frothy discharge at the inner canthus (meibomian foam). This causes burning sensation on first waking in the morning.\r\n\r\n- Primary meibomitis: Primary meibomitis is characterised by diffuse inflammation around meibomian gland orifices. It may be associated with acne rosacea or seborrhoeic dermatitis.\r\n\r\nThe meibomian gland orifices may show pouting and be capped by domes of oil (meibomana). Meibomian gland secretions may be turbid and contain particulate debris. Firm pressure on tarsal glands show inspissated secretions.\r\n\r\nObliteration of main meibomian ducts may cause secondary cystic dilatation and formation of chalazion (meibomian cyst). In advanced cases, posterior lid margin may show thickening, rounding, vascularisation and notching. There may be secondary changes like papillary conjunctivitis, inferior punctate epitheliopathy and tear film instability.\r\n\r\n- Meibomitis with secondary blepharitis: Meibomitis with secondary blepharitis is always associated with seborrhoeic dermatitis. In contrast to primary meibomitis, involvement of meibomian glands is mild and patchy. There is inflammation surrounding the glands and secretions are solidified and are difficult to express. Secondary conjunctival and corneal changes are usually mild. Some patients may have associated tear film instability.\r\nSalient features in general are:-\r\n- Plugging of meibomian glands.\r\n- Inspissated lipid secretions.\r\n- Inflammation of gland orifices.\r\n- Blockage of orifices may cause chalazion formation or hordeolum due to infection.\r\n- Tear film instability.\r\n- Papillary conjunctivitis.\r\n\r\nCorneal changes can also result from posterior blepharitis.\r\nDiagnostic procedures:-\r\nThere are no specific clinical diagnostic tests for blepharitis, however, following tests may be helpful:-\r\n- Culture from eyelid margins: Culture from eyelid margins may be done for patients with recurrent anterior blepharitis having severe inflammation or who are not responding to treatment.\r\n- Microscopic evaluation: Microscopic evaluation of eyelashes may reveal Demodex mites.\r\n- Biopsy: Biopsy from eyelid may be indicated to exclude the possibility of carcinoma in cases showing marked asymmetry or one with unifocal recurrent chalazion not responding to therapy.\r\nHistological findings:\r\n- Seborrhoeic blepharitis: Seborrhoeic blepharitis shows spongiosis, mild perivascular lymphohistiocytic, mononuclear cellular infiltrates in superficial dermis.\r\n- Staphylococcal blepharitis: Staphylococcal blepharitis is a chronic non-granulomatous inflammation, usually with neutrophils and often shows acanthosis or parakeratosis.\r\n\r\nImaging studies:\r\n- LipiView (Tear science): LipiView (Tear science) allows visualisation of individual meibomian glands in everted inferior tarsal plate and produces semi-quantitative analysis of meibomian gland viability. This also measures incomplete blink rate and thickness of lipid oil layer.\r\n- Keratograph 5M (Oculus): Keratograph 5M (Oculus) may be used to obtain images of meibomian glands.\r\nBlepharitis should be differentiated from conditions like:\r\n- Bacterial infections: Bacterial infections such as impetigo or erysipelas.\r\n- Viral infections: Viral infections like papillomavirus or vaccinia.\r\n- Parasitic infections: Parasitic infections e.g. Phthirus pubis (Pediculosis palpebrarum).\r\n- Dermatoses: Dermatoses such as psoriasis and erythroderma.\r\n- Immunological conditions: Immunological conditions like atopic dermatitis or contact dermatitis.\r\n- Benign eyelid tumours: Benign eyelid tumours like actinic keratosis or squamous cell papilloma.\r\n- Malignant eyelid tumours: Malignant eyelid tumours like basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.\r\n- Trauma: Trauma may be mechanical, thermal or produced by radiations.\r\n-Toxic conditions: Toxic condition such as medicamentosa (produced by use of medicines)."

                "Band Shaped Keratopathy (Calcific band keratopathy, or band keratopathy) is a non-specific corneal condition characterised by chronic deposition of calcium salts (principally hydroxyapatite) within the basement membrane, Bowman\u2019s layer and anterior stromal lamellae of the corneal epithelium (leaving remainder of the cornea clear). Initially, corneal degenerative changes begin near the limbus, either on nasal, temporal or both sides together in exposed palpebral fissure at 3 to 9 o\u2019clock position. Calcific band is concentric with the limbus but is separated from it by a clear zone (representing a lucid interval) due to lack of Bowman\u2019s layer at the periphery, or due to buffering action at the limbus. Keratopathy appears as a superficial greyish-white corneal opacity having frosted or ground glass appearance. The opacity is covered by clear epithelium with lacunae of uninvolved tissue. There are numerous holes where corneal nerves penetrate the Bowman\u2019s layer. The disease progresses toward the corneal center and thickens as well in its anterior and posterior dimensions, resulting in more opaque, whitish surface with increased nodularity. Calcium deposits thicken and may cause breakdown of the overlying epithelium, resulting in the appearance of spontaneous and recurrent corneal epithelial erosions.\r\nBand shaped keratopathy may occur as isolated condition or in association with a variety of disease entities. The corneal involvement is described as band shaped keratopathy because of the band-like distribution of the deposits across the interpalpebral zone. Unlike band shaped keratopathy, calcareous degeneration usually spares the basement and Bowman\u2019s membrane and is characterised by clumps of calcium salts in the superficial and deep stroma.\r\nPatients with keratopathy may remain relatively asymptomatic for a considerable length of time in early stages of the disease, as long as the central visual axis of the cornea remains clear. With progression of the disease, there is diminution of visual acuity and pain in the eyes due to disruption of the corneal epithelium.\r\nIdentification of corneal and conjunctival degenerations has improved with the use of confocal microscopy, immuno-histochemical staining and genetic testing."

                "Numerous mechanisms, whether systemic or local to the eye, by which the balance of the calcium phosphate solubility product are tilted toward abnormal tissue calcification resulting nonspecific finding of band keratopathy. As such, there are many diseases associated with this condition. Though we tend to think first of conditions such as uveitis and systemic hypercalcaemia, in a recent series the most commonly associated causes of calcific band keratopathy were chronic corneal oedema, phthisis bulbi, and even idiopathic cases.\r\nSystemic disease associations:\r\nHypercalcaemia (elevated serum calcium level) may be due to:\r\n\r\nHyperparathyroidism.\r\nOver treatment for hypoparathyroidism.\r\nVitamin D intoxication.\r\nSarcoidosis.\r\nMultiple myeloma.\r\nPaget\u2019s disease.\r\nMilk-alkali syndrome.\r\nEnd stage renal disease: In end-stage renal disease, elevation of either serum calcium, phosphate, or both may disrupt the equilibrium towards precipitation.\r\nHypophosphatasia: Hypophosphatasia, an inborn error of metabolism involving decreased alkaline phosphatase activity and resultant hypercalcaemia (less common).\r\nTumoral calcinosis: Tumoral calcinosis, a rare syndrome characterised by periarticular calcium deposition, has also been reported as a systemic association (less common).\r\n\r\nIn some cases, reversal of serum hypercalcaemia through treatment of the underlying disease will lead to spontaneous resolution of band keratopathy within a few months.\r\nHyperuricaemia: Hyperuricaemia may lead to band keratopathy and is differentiated based on clinical history, the golden-brown colour on examination, and elevated uric acid levels.\r\nHeredity: Primary hereditary band keratopathy.\r\n\r\nAssociation with chronic ocular conditions:\r\nNumerous chronic ocular conditions may similarly predispose to the development of calcific band keratopathy such as:\r\n\r\nUveitis (chronic iritis in particular, affiliated with Juvenile idiopathic arthritis). In general, the severity of band keratopathy relates directly to the duration of ocular inflammation, though the specific details of the cause and effect relationship between uveitis and corneal mineralisation remains poorly understood.\r\nChronic ocular inflammation.\r\nAbsolute glaucoma.\r\nChronic corneal oedema.\r\nPhthisis bulbi.\r\nInterstitial keratitis.\r\nOcular toxicity: Whereas band keratopathy typically develops over months to years, several of these iatrogenic aetiologies demonstrate rapid onset of the corneal changes. Ocular toxicity may be due to:\r\n\r\n- Mercurial preservatives: Degenerative calcium deposition associated with chronic damage from mercurial preservatives in many ophthalmic preparations (e.g. phenyl-mercuric nitrate or thiomersal).\r\n- Topical steroid-phosphate preparations.\r\n- Intraocular use of silicone oil.\r\n- Intraocular use of sodium hyaluronate and chondroitin sulphate: Intraocular use of sodium hyaluronate and chondroitin sulphate during routine cataract extraction.\r\nThe causes of band shaped keratopathy can be broadly divided into six categories:\r\n\r\nChronic inflammation: Chronic keratitis, chronic uveitis of any cause and ocular trauma, along with its accompanying chronic Inflammation, are the most common ocular causes of band shaped keratopathy.\r\nMercurial preservatives: Degenerative calcium deposition associated with chronic damage from mercurial preservatives in many ophthalmic preparations viz. long-term use of phenyl-mercuric nitrate preserved miotic therapy,or thiomersal containing artificial tears used for severe dry eye.\r\nHypercalcaemia: Hypercalcaemia secondary to milk alkali syndrome, vitamin D toxicity, sarcoidosis, hyperparathyroidism, lytic lesions affecting the bones, and other systemic diseases.\r\nRaised serum phosphorus levels: Chronic renal failure, uraemia, or other conditions, that may cause a rise in serum phosphorus levels.\r\nHeredity: Primary hereditary band keratopathy.\r\nSilicone oil instillation in an aphakic eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nPathogenesis:\r\nSince its first description by Dixon in 1848, much remains elusive regarding the exact pathogenesis of Band keratopathy. It is not clear why the disease typically starts at the limbus with an intervening clear space.\r\nThe principal calcium salt deposited in band keratopathy, hydroxyapatite, is a complex crystal composed primarily of calcium and phosphate. The solubility of calcium phosphate in organic tissues in general is quite low and this product exists in a near supersaturated state in blood and interstitial tissue. Disruption of this equilibrium with resultant precipitation of calcium phosphate may readily occur with:\r\n\r\nAn increase in pH\r\nIncrease in local concentration of either ion\r\nAbrupt loss of solvent (e.g. evaporative loss of aqueous tear layer) or\r\nAppearance of calcium phosphate crystal nucleus in near supersaturated tissue.\r\n\r\nIt is surmised that hypercalcaemia alone was likely not sufficient to produce disease. The suggested possible mechanisms may be:\r\n\r\nAbnormalities in the transport and mobilisation of calcium in interstitial fluid: Abnormalities in the transport and mobilisation of calcium in interstitial fluid likely drive deposition.\r\nDysfunction of the sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (NBCe1): Dysfunction of the sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (NBCe1) in corneal tissues, sufficiently impairs efflux of bicarbonate from the stroma into the aqueous, thereby raising local pH and predisposing to band keratopathy.\r\nLocalisation of disease to the interpalpebral fissure: Localisation of disease to the interpalpebral fissure, while unrelated to ultraviolet light exposure, may stem from the local effects of evaporative tear film loss.\r\nLoss of carbon dioxide: Loss of carbon dioxide through diffusion at any exposed mucosal surface would raise local pH and thereby promote deposition. Local pH may explain further the propensity for the crystals to deposit in Bowman\u2019s layer and anterior stromal layers, as deeper corneal lamellae have a lower pH due to lactic acid accumulation from anaerobic glycolysis. It is still not clear whether epithelial basement membrane is structurally more conducive to the sudden precipitation of crystalline calcium phosphate.\r\n\r\nSome have asserted that the limbal vasculature may provide a buffer against pH changes, possibly explaining the commonly noted clear interval of uninvolved tissue at the limbus."

                "Diagnosis of band shaped keratopathy depends upon clinical presentation.\r\nClinical history:\r\nPatients with band shaped keratopathy are asymptomatic in the early stages of the disease. Symptomatic patients should be enquired about the severity and duration of symptoms.\r\nHistory of systemic disease: \r\n\r\nAny systemic disease causing hyperglycaemia.\r\nVitamin D intake: Patients should be questioned concerning excessive vitamin D ingestion. Although corneal calcification may be reversible with discontinuation of the vitamin, nephrocalcinosis may still develop.\r\nJoint pains.\r\n\r\nHistory of ocular conditions:\r\n\r\nOcular symptoms like Irritation, foreign body sensation, watering or diminution of vision.\r\nAny history suggestive of chronic uveitis or inflammation of eyes.\r\nUse of topical eye preparations containing steroid phosphate or mercurial preservatives.\r\nSilicone eye injection.\r\nLong standing glaucoma.\r\n\r\nClinical examination:\r\nA general medical workup is advisable in patients with systemic association of the disease.\r\nExamination of eyes should be carried out under slit lamp (bio-microscopy) by an eye specialist.\r\n\r\nBand shaped keratopathy: Initially, corneal degenerative changes are seen concentric with the limbus, either on nasal, temporal or both sides together in exposed palpebral fissure at 3 to 9 o\u2019clock position. Calcific band is separated from the limbus by a clear zone (representing a lucid interval). Keratopathy appears as a superficial greyish-white corneal opacity resembling frosted or ground glass, with \u2018white flecks\u2019 and \u2018clear spots\u2019 interspersed within the band, giving it a \u2018Swiss cheese\u2019 appearance. The opacity is covered by clear epithelium with lacunae of uninvolved tissue. Later, the disease progresses toward the corneal center and thickens resulting in more opaque, whitish surface with increased nodularity. Thickened calcium deposits may cause breakdown of the overlying epithelium, resulting in the appearance of spontaneous and recurrent corneal epithelial erosions or epithelial defects.\r\nSigns of chronic inflammation or uveitis. \r\nSigns of long standing glaucoma.\r\nSilicone oil in anterior chamber.\r\n\r\nHistopathology:\r\nThere is deposition of calcium in epithelial basement membrane, Bowman\u2019s layer and anterior stroma which is characteristically seen as sub-epithelial basophilic granular degeneration in band shaped distribution with haematoxylin and eosin stain (H&amp;E stain). With disease progression, large calcium phosphate granules, with traces of sulphur and silicone, become confluent and hyaline deposits may be appreciable between layers of redundant, calcified Bowman\u2019s membrane. Masses of eosinophilic amorphous connective tissue insinuate themselves between the fragments of calcified Bowman\u2019s layer and the overlying epithelium, and there is patchy calcification of the anterior lamellae of the stroma. Calcium is also deposited in areas where there are signs of fibroblastic proliferation.\r\nSpecial stains such as alizarin red or von-kossa stain may be used to confirm the findings.\r\nLaboratory diagnosis:\r\nLaboratory diagnosis may include tests to diagnose any systemic association of band shaped keratopathy such as:\r\n\r\nSerum calcium and phosphate levels.\r\nSerum parathormone level.\r\nRenal function tests viz. blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.\r\nAngiotensin converting enzyme levels, x-ray or spiral computerised tomography (CT) scan of chest may be done in suspected cases of sarcoid.\r\n\r\nImaging studies:\r\nImaging studies may help in a search for lytic lesions affecting the bones.\r\n\r\nCalcific band keratopathy should be differentiated from:\r\n\r\nPrimary and secondary calcareous degeneration of cornea.\r\nSpheroidal degeneration or droplet keratopathy which shows band like deposition of hyaline.\r\nSalzmann nodular degeneration.\r\nBlood staining of cornea.\r\nAdvanced anterior basement membrane dystrophy of cornea.\r\nCalciphylaxis: Calciphylaxis is a condition of induced ocular and systemic hypersensitivity reaction, characterised by calcium deposition in response to specific antigens or agents. For example, it takes place in children with uveitis or in patients given calciferol.\r\nTopical ciprofloxacin solution particle deposition.\r\nLimbal stem cell deficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalcific band keratopathy versus calcareous degeneration of the cornea: \r\nCalcareous degeneration of the cornea usually affects the deep layers as well as the anterior layers. Calcareous degeneration occurs in severely diseased eyes with exposed stroma and vascular compromise or in eyes undergoing multiple operations. It has also been reported in a failed corneal graft. Calcareous degeneration of the cornea as seen in seriously injured eyes, phthisis bulbi, and necrotic neoplasms is often accompanied by bone formation elsewhere in the globe. However, primary calcareous degeneration may occur in the absence of systemic disease or calcium metabolic disturbances. The sub epithelial deposition is bilateral, and occasional bouts of irritation may occur."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nTherapeutic goals for the management of band keratopathy are:\r\n\r\nTo re-establish normal corneal and limbal topography,\r\nTo improve visual function if there is potential for it, and\r\nTo provide symptomatic relief from recurrent erosions and ulcers.\r\n\r\nOcular therapy is indicated only if the patient is symptomatic.\r\nDistinguishing local and systemic causes of band shaped keratopathy appropriately outlines treatment options and prognosis for the patient. Removal of the inciting agent in iatrogenic cases or correction of the systemic metabolic disturbance may correct the pathology. Correction of the systemic metabolic disturbance may delay recurrence of the disease after treatment. More so, detection of band keratopathy may occasionally uncover a systemic disease which may be life-threatening.\r\nSuperficial debridement or lamellar keratectomy in band keratopathy is usually effective in restoring normal vision. Adverse outcomes such as corneal scarring and vision loss may result from the procedure, but the incidence of such complications is low.\r\nGeneral measures:\r\n\r\nDiet: Diet may be controlled to prevent excessive absorption and serum elevation of calcium associated with vitamin D intake and milk-alkali syndrome as a measure for band keratopathy.\r\nTopical artificial tears: Topical artificial tears may be used as ocular surface lubricants in patients with mild symptoms of discomfort.\r\n\r\nMedical therapy: \r\nAlthough medical therapy is ineffective in treating band keratopathy, underlying systemic conditions associated with elevated levels of calcium and phosphate should be treated to prevent recurrence.\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\nThe goal of surgery is to remove opaque plaques of calcium, without inducing visually significant stromal scarring.\r\nPrior to surgical management of band keratopathy, it is important to consider:\r\n\r\nVisual acuity and future visual potential of the affected eye.\r\nHealth and visual function of the contra-lateral eye.\r\nAge, level of cooperation, and family support of patient.\r\nAssurance to the patient about the surgery.\r\nAlthough final visual acuity is difficult to predict, patient can expect improved visual function.\r\nPatient should be prepared for realistic postoperative goals.\r\nThe probability of recurrent corneal disease always exists. Degeneration may recur even bilaterally following corneal transplantation.\r\n\r\nCandidates for surgical treatment of band keratopathy are:\r\n\r\nPatients with central or paracentral corneal involvement affecting visual function.\r\nBand keratopathy causing recurrent epithelial erosions with pain.\r\n\r\nContraindications to surgery:\r\n\r\nActive infectious process such as keratitis: Active infectious process such as keratitis, should be treated first.\r\nGross lid abnormalities and mal-positions: Any gross lid abnormalities and malpositions (e.g. ectropion, entropion, or severe seborrhoeic blepharitis) should be treated beforehand, since it alleviates wound healing complications in the postoperative period.\r\nHerpes disease: It is advisable to proceed cautiously in patients with known herpetic disease. The surgical trauma and postoperative steroids may reactivate an immunologic response. Perioperative treatment with antivirals acyclovir or valcyclovir is recommended to lessen the risk of disease recurrence.\r\n\r\nSurgical procedures:\r\nSuperficial debridement: The primary goal of superficial debridement is to clear the visual axis. Superficial debridement of band keratopathy can be performed in a sterile manner in outpatient setting preferably under magnification. Though, any local anaesthesia (e.g. proparacaine) may be used, but cocaine as local anaesthetic facilitates the separation of corneal epithelium from Bowman\u2019s layer. This allows ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid (EDTA) to work more effectively.\r\nCorneal epithelium is removed with a blunt spatula from the limbus toward the center (out-to-in or centripetal direction). For difficult areas of calcium, a diamond-burr tip on a Fisch drill may be used.\r\nFollowing the procedure, irrigate the eye thoroughly to remove EDTA solution from the conjunctival surface and fornices. Pressure patch is applied after cyclopentolate and topical steroid-antibiotic drops or ointment.\r\nNeodymium- doped Yttrium Aluminium Garnet laser (Nd: YAG laser): Calcific band keratopathy can be treated using an Nd: YAG laser. This technique offers advantages of ease of performance, rapid resolution of the patient symptoms, and a smooth corneal surface. It has fallen out of favour with the advent of Argon fluoride excimer laser.\r\nExcimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy: Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy may be used to polish the irregular corneal surface to make it smooth, after the plaque has been removed. Excimer laser should not be used to remove calcium in band keratopathy. Attempt to remove band keratopathy with the excimer laser alone may result in significant irregular corneal astigmatism, since the cornea may be ablated preferentially. Excimer laser does not differentiate between normal corneal tissue and calcified lesions. Further, the excimer laser ablates normal tissues at faster rates than calcified or scarred lesions.\r\nLamellar keratectomy: Lamellar keratectomy may be required for more advanced cases. A lamellar keratectomy involving removal of epithelium, Bowman\u2019s layer, and a portion of the anterior stroma, may be performed in cases in which the corneal surface is thickened irregularly and the area of pathology is fairly extensive. It is accomplished with a blade or rotating diamond burr. Any bleeding from associated corneal neovascularisation or interstitial keratitis requires pressure patching or topical vasoconstrictors.\r\nAnterior segment \u2013 optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) or Rotating Scheimpflug imaging technique (measures anterior and posterior corneal surfaces) can help measure the extent of the pathology as well as the expected residual stromal bed.\r\nBandage contact lens: Bandage contact lens may be used following superficial debridement or lamellar keratectomy. The bandage contact lenses produce significant relief in pain, protect blink disruption of re-epithelialisation, and provide a scaffold for epithelial migration from the limbus.\r\nAmniotic membrane graft: In recalcitrant cases, amniotic membrane graft may be applied to cover and promote healing, particularly when delayed epithelialisation is anticipated, such as in patients with chronic ocular surface inflammation or advanced age.\r\nAmniotic membrane graft can be used as an adjunct therapy after the calcific deposits are surgically or chemically removed. The amniotic membrane graft should include a thick amniotic membrane with basement membrane to promote wound healing and replace the lost basement membrane and stromal matrix. The amniotic membrane should be placed in a \u2018\u2019 basement membrane down\u201d orientation so that the basement membrane is in direct contact with the underlying stroma. Amniotic membrane graft is secured with sutures or biocompatible fibrin glue. Graft cannot be used as a sole therapy for band keratopathy.\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nPatients with band keratopathy may experience diminution of vision as the deposition progresses across the visual axis. A foreign body sensation and irritation associated with an irregular surface are common symptoms. The ocular discomfort may worsen to the point of becoming disabling, especially as smaller segments of the plaque loosen and become partially mobile. The plaque itself often is visible and of cosmetic concern to the patient and family members.\r\nUnless underlying conditions have been addressed, removing the calcium deposits in band keratopathy will be associated with a high incidence of recurrence. In general, however, superficial debridement or lamellar keratectomy restores vision and comfort for most of the patients with band keratopathy, with the incidence of adverse outcomes following this procedure being very low."

                "Burns are a serious public health problem. A burn is defined as an injury to the skin or other organic tissue primarily caused by heat or due to radiation, radioactivity, electricity, friction or contact with chemicals.\r\nHeat burns occur when some or all of the different layers of cells in the skin are destroyed by a hot liquid (scald), a hot solid (contact burn) or a flame (flame burn). Skin injuries due to ultraviolet radiation, radioactivity, electricity or chemicals, as well as respiratory damage resulting from smoke inhalation, are also considered as burns.\r\nAccording to WHO estimates about 265 000 deaths occur each year from fires alone globally, with more deaths from scalds, electrical burns, and other forms of burns for which data are not available. The majority of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, with almost half occur in the WHO South-East Asia Region.\r\nIn India around 7 million people suffer from burn injuries each year with 1.4 lakh deaths and 2.4 lakh people suffer with disability. Burn death rates have been decreasing in high income countries.\r\nFemales and males show similar rates for burns in contrast to other injury patterns where rates of injury are higher in males than females. The higher risk for females is associated with open fire cooking, or unsafe cook stoves, loose clothing. Self-directed or interpersonal violence is also a factor for burn injuries.\r\nAlong with adult females, children are also vulnerable to burns. Out of 5 burn victims 4 are women and children. Burns are the fifth most common cause of non-fatal childhood injuries and 11th leading cause of death of children aged 1-9 years. Among all people globally, infants have the highest death rates from burns.\r\nBurns are also a leading cause of morbidity; millions who survive suffer from lifelong disability and disfigurements with resulting emotional trauma and stigma.\r\nBurns are preventable. Increased efforts in prevention and care would lead to significant reduction in burn-related morbidity, mortality and disability.\r\nThe National Programme for Prevention, Management and Rehabilitation of Burn Injuries (NPPMRBI) is an initiative by the Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India to strengthen the preventive, curative and rehabilitative services for burn victims.\r\nFind more information-\r\nPractical Hand Book on Burns Management, NPPMRBI, MOHFW,GOI"

Young children are mostly affected by scalds.\r\nHot solids (Contact burns): Solid objects that are hot can cause contact burns, especially in children. Sources of burns from solid objects include ashes and coal, hot pressing irons, soldering equipment, cooking utensils (frying pans and pots), oven containers, light bulbs, and exhaust pipes.\r\nFlames: Burns can be due to leaking gas pipe or cylinder, accidents from kerosene pressure stove, lighting of crackers during \u201cDiwali\u201d, catching of fires in tents as pandal fires.\r\nChemical burns-These are accidental burns in homes (such as from toilet cleaning agents), or as acid violence attacks (throwing of acid over somebody for seeking revenge and attempts to resolve disputes of love, land or business) and work place accidents.\r\nElectrical burns- Electrical burns are due to exposed \u201clive\u201d wires or short circuits. High tension wires close to homes, play areas and roads can lead to electrical burns.\r\n\r\nInhalational burns:\r\n\r\nInhalational burns are the result of breathing in superheated gases, steam, hot liquids or noxious products of incomplete combustion.\r\nThey cause thermal injury to the upper airway, irritation or chemical injury to the airways from soot, asphyxiation, and toxicity from carbon monoxide (CO) and other gases such as cyanide and accompany a skin burn in approximately 20% to 35% of cases. \r\nInhalational burns are the most common cause of death among people suffering fire-related burn.\r\n\r\nRisk factors:\r\nBurns are more common in rural areas and urban poor of low income countries; some of the factors that are of prime concern include:\r\n\r\nuse of cooking pots on ground level (floor cooking): toddlers and young children are at increased risk of scald burns as they can easily knock over the pots on the ground level;\r\nuse of open wood fires;\r\nwearing of loose fitting cotton clothing (loose chunnis and pallus) can catch fire while cooking on an open fire (a risk factor for women in Asia); or due to faulty habits like use of clothing to hold cooking pot.\r\n\r\nOther risk factors are:\r\n\r\nExposure to fire during occupation;\r\npoverty, overcrowding(single room houses with kitchen adjacent to bed/play area for children)\r\nyoung girls performing household work as cooking and care of small children;\r\nsmoking and alcohol abuse;\r\ninadequate safety measures for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and electricity;\r\nunderlying medical conditions such as epilepsy, physical and cognitive disabilities.\r\n\r\nBurns can occur in home and workplace. Children and women are usually burned in homes in their kitchens from hot liquids, flames, or from cook stove explosions. Men are mostly burned in the workplace due to fire, scalds, chemical and electrical burns."

History regarding cause of burns and age should be inquired as it helps in diagnosing extent and depth of burns, such as: \r\n\r\nFlame burns are usually full thickness burns, scald burns from hot water spilling may be superficial burns while scalds from ghee, oil are likely to be deep. Chemical and electrical burns are deep.\r\nAge of patients-At extremes of age (infants and older patents) burns are deep because of thinness of skin.\r\n\r\nb. Examination: The severity of the burn is determined by burned surface area, depth of burn and other considerations. Morbidity and mortality rises with increasing burned surface area. It also rises with increasing age so that even small burns may be fatal in elderly people.\r\nWhole body surface area is taken as 100%. Proportion of surface burn is represented as percentage(%). There are many ways to estimate the body surface area burned.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cRule of 9\u2019s\u201d is commonly used to estimate the total body surface area (TBSA) burned in adults. In this, body is divided into 11 equal parts making this 99% and 1% is given to perineum. Therefore 9% each for the head and each upper limb; 18% each for each lower limb, front of trunk and back of trunk*.\r\nIn newborns and children (younger than 10 years), because of the larger size of head and small body surface area of limbs, the Rule of Nine is not applicable. Lund and Browder chart can be used for the calculation of total body surface area of burns in children*.\r\nThe \u201cRule of Palm\u201d is one closed hand of an individual is equal to his 1% body surface area. (A hand consists of all the fingers and thumb brought together in extended position with palm).\r\n\r\nInitially most of the burn patients are well oriented and may look like as if suffering from a simple injury but any burn above 5% should be taken seriously.\r\nBurns can be classified as minor, moderate and critical burns according to severity:\r\nMinor burns-\r\n\r\nBurns less than 15% in adults and 10% in children (excluding chemical, electrical burns and burns of face, hands and perineum).\r\nThese burns can be treated on out-patient basis.\r\n\r\nModerate burns-\r\n\r\nBurns between 15-25% in adults and 10-15% in children.\r\nMay require hospitalization.\r\n\r\nCritical burns-\r\n\r\nBurns above 25% in adults, 15% in children and 5% in newborn and infants.\r\nElectrical burns\r\nChemical burns\r\nRespiratory burns\r\nBurns associated with other injuries\r\n\r\nOrthopaedic injury\r\nChest injury\r\nAbdominal injury\r\nHead injury"

The first aid has to be provided by the bystanders, who become the \u201cfirst responders\u201d. Extent of damage can be minimized by providing quick and proper on the site management.\r\nOn site management (first aid: Cool, Cover, Call):The basic principles of first aid remain the same for all categories of burns with some specific management for particular category. Rescuer should take care of his/ her own safety before helping burn victim.\r\nThermal burns-\r\n\r\nThe victim should be removed from the burning premises.\r\nThe victim should be asked to lie down on the floor with burning side upper most (stop drop and roll)(tough rolling is not advised by some experts as this practice can transfer the fire to previously undamaged areas and can also cause other injuries) . Lying flat prevents the flames from involving the face, head and scalp hairs and also prevents the fire from going around the body (as flames go upwards).\r\nPrevent the victim from running as it only fans the flames.\r\nIf the victim is unable to walk or unconscious, drag him from burning site.\r\nIf there is lot of smoke along with fire, the rescuer should stay low/ crawl on the floor to minimize the inhalation of the toxic fumes (as the smoke, gases and hot air tend to rise). Breathing should be done through the wet handkerchief to filter out the fumes, carbon and other toxic particles.\r\nPour water in copious amounts over the victim to extinguish the flames and to reduce the temperature of the burn.\r\nIn the absence of water any other non-inflammable clear liquid such as milk, canned drink can be used. Or\r\nThe victim should be put on the ground with the burning side uppermost and then wrapped in a heavy cotton cloth (blanket/rug/dari/coat or any other heavy fabric).Once the fire extinguishes, the blanket should be immediately removed as it can retain the heat. (Nylon or other inflammable material should not be used for this purpose). \r\nFire extinguishers can be used for putting out the fire.\r\nDon\u2019t throw/apply mud/sand over the victim\u2019s body to put out the fire.\r\nAllthe burnt clothes (including belts, socks and shoes) and the ornaments (necklace, wrist watch, bangles, bracelets, nose-rings, ear-rings, rings around the fingers and toes, anklets) should also be removed.\r\nDo not apply any ointments, creams, lotions, powders,grease, ghee, gentian violet,calamine lotion, toothpastes, butter, colouring and other sticky agents, over the burn wound.\r\nTo avoid contamination, the burnt parts should be wrapped in a clean, dry sheet/cloth. Upper and lower limb injuries could be wrapped in pillow cover/plastic bags. Wrapping of wounds also reduces pain due to the air currents and provides protection during transport.\r\nIf burn injuries occur in closed chamber, patients may develop carbon monoxide poisoning. In such cases cleaning of the throat and putting oxygen mask during transportation is required.\r\nLook for associated injuries (fractures or spinal injuries) and take care accordingly.\r\nDon\u2019t give anything to eat and drink as this may result in vomiting.\r\nFormal oral analgesics are usually not given in the first aid. Reassurance and consolation to the victim and the family are important components of early care.\r\nCo-morbid conditions/other pre-existing conditions (such as pregnant women, alcoholism, and drug addictions) should be inquired.\r\nSeek immediate medical help. First 6 hours following injury are critical; transport the patient with severe burns to a hospital as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nChemical burns: \r\n\r\nIn chemical burns, remove or dilute the chemical agent by irrigating with large volumes of water.\r\nS.A.F.E. approach is recommended. S \u2013 Shout for help, A \u2013 Assess the scene quickly, F \u2013 Free from danger of violence, E \u2013 Evaluate the casualty.\r\nThe victims should be rushed to the nearest medical care units at the earliest.\r\n\r\nElectrical burns:\r\n\r\nSwitch off the power supply and victim should be removed with a non-conducting material like a dry wooden stick/pole/wooden chair.\r\nNo such maneuver should be attempted while a person is connected to a high voltage source, as the current is likely to \u201carc\u201d to the rescuer as he approaches.\r\nLook for airway, breathing and circulation. If there is no response or respiration, the victim most likely has suffered cardiac arrest and CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) should be started immediately at the site.\r\nLook for associated injuries.\r\nCall for help immediately.\r\n\r\nLightning injury:\r\n\r\nThe victims of lightning injuries are managed in the same way as those of electrical injuries. These patients can withstand apnoea (cessation of breathing) for very long periods of time. Sometimes prolonged resuscitation with cardiac massage and ventilation is required.\r\n\r\nManagement-\r\na. Initial management includes assessment and maintenance of following parameters with ABCDE approach:\r\n\r\nAirway assessment and management in case of inhalational burns (burns in closed space, deep dermal burns to face, neck, or trunk, singed nasal hair ,carbon particles in oropharynx). \r\nBreathing: beware of inhalation and rapid airway compromise. \r\nCirculation: ensure fluid replacement by securing wide bore intravenous line through which Ringer lactate solution can be given rapidly. Oral fluids such as ORS (Oral rehydration solution) may be given after initial resuscitation.\r\nDisability: evaluation for neurological deficit or any gross disability. Compartment syndrome occurs when excessive pressure builds up inside an enclosed space in the body. The legs, arms, and abdomen are mostly affected by compartment syndrome. Treatments for compartment syndrome focus on reducing the dangerous pressure in the body compartment. Dressings, casts, or splints that are constricting the affected body part must be removed.\r\nExposure: (Percentage area of burn), the whole of a patient should be examined (including the back) to get an accurate estimate of the burn area and to check for any concomitant injuries.\r\n\r\nb. In all cases, tetanus prophylaxis should be administered.\r\nc. Wound care:\r\n\r\nAdherent necrotic (dead) tissue should be cleaned.\r\nAfter debridement, the burn should be cleansed with either 0.25% (2.5 g/litre) chlorhexidine solution or 0.1% (1 g/litre) cetrimide solution, or with mild water based antiseptic. (Do not use alcohol-based solutions).\r\nA thin layer of antibiotic cream (silver sulfadiazine) should be applied.\r\nThe burn area is dressed with petroleum gauze and dry gauze thick enough to prevent seepage to the outer layers.\r\n\r\nd. Systemic antibiotics are given to treat and prevent wound infections.\r\ne. Proper nutrition with adequate supply of energy and proteins should be given to patients.\r\nf. Specialized care may be provided during healing process in the form of skin grafts or surgical release of contractures due to scars.\r\nFirst aid:\r\nDo's-\r\n\r\nStop the burning process by removing clothing, jewelry and irrigating the burns.\r\nIn electrical burns, put the main switch off as quickly as possible and use a wooden scale or rod wooden chair to push the victim away from electricity. (No such maneuver should be attempted while a person is connected to a high voltage source, as the current is likely to \u201carc\u201d to the rescuer as he approaches)\r\nExtinguish flames by pouring plain water; if water is not available by applying a blanket and removing the blanket as soon as the flames are put off.\r\nIn chemical burns, remove or dilute the chemical agent by irrigating with large volumes of water.\r\nUse cool running water to reduce the temperature of the burn.\r\nWrap the patient in a clean cloth or sheet and transport to the nearest appropriate facility for medical care.\r\nTake care of fractures and probable injuries during transportation.\r\nEnsure A-Airway, B-Breathing &amp; C-Circulation before transportation to higher center.\r\n\r\nDon'ts-\r\n\r\nDo not start first aid before ensuring your own safety (switch off electrical current, wear gloves for chemicals etc.)\r\nDo not apply ice because it may further damage the injured tissues.\r\nAvoid prolonged cooling with water because it may cause hypothermia (low temperature).\r\nDo not apply paste, oil, haldi (turmeric) or raw cotton to the burn or any other material.\r\nDo not open blisters with needle or pin, until topical antimicrobials can be applied, such as by a health-care provider."

It produces eyelid tissue relaxation and latter atrophy. It may be unilateral in some cases. In addition to recurrent attacks of oedema, it is associated with \u2018cigarette-paper\u2019 skin and subcutaneous telangiectasia.\r\nThe term blepharochalasis was coined by Fuchs in1896. The term blepharochalasis is frequently misused to indicate redundant skin of the ageing eyelid, a common condition more accurately termed as dermatochalasis.\r\nThe word blepharochalasis originates from the Greek word blepharon meaning eyelid and chalasis meaning relaxing."

If you don't brush and floss daily, food particles accumulate in between your teeth and on tongue; bacteria grow on the food left in your mouth and leave foul-smelling waste products (volatile sulphur compounds) behind, which lead to bad breath.\r\nLack of regular tongue cleaning, may be a cause of bad breath despite proper brushing and flossing. \r\n\r\n\r\nDietary Habits:\r\n\r\nIntake of certain foods and drinks such as onion, garlic, spices etc. and certain habits such as smoking, using tobacco products, drinking alcohol cause halitosis.\r\nFasting or starvation can also cause bad breath.\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF HALITOSIS:\r\nSource of 90% cases of bad breath is oral cavity such as food impaction in between teeth, gum diseases, dry mouth or reduced flow of saliva. Dry mouth ordecreased flow of saliva reduces self-cleaning of the mouth and inadequate cleaning of the mouth causes halitosis.\r\nNot maintaining hygiene of orthodontic fixed appliances, wearing dentures and not cleaning them regularly, throat infections, oral ulcers and oral carcinomas may cause bad breath.\r\nNon-oral reasons such as sinus (upper respiratory tract infections), diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis), lung and kidney diseases (end stage renal failure), gastrointestinal disease such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), menstruation (menstrual breath) accounts for 9% of halitosis cases.\r\nIn 1% of patients, the source of halitosis is diets or drugs."

                "Habitual grinding or clenching of teeth, either during sleep or as an unconscious habit during waking hours, is known as Bruxism and commonly called as \u201cTeeth Grinding\u201d.\r\nPavon described bruxism as one of the most common, complex and destructive dental functional disorder (parafunctional habit). Initially, it is difficult to identify mainly as the patients themselves are unaware of it. According to Nadler, bruxism affecta large percentage of the population, including all age groups. In some individuals it may be considered as an attempt to cope with stress and anxiety.\r\nBruxism, usually, does not have any harmful effects but when it occurs on regular basis, it causes tooth wear, occlusal trauma, temporomandibular joint problems, and hypertrophy of muscles. Correct diagnosis is necessary for its treatment.\r\nPARAFUNCTIONAL HABITS:\r\nDrum introduced the term \u201cparafunction\u201d. Parafunctional activities, also known as muscle hyperactivity, are non-functional, oro-mandibular or lingual activities such as bruxism, jaw clenching, tooth tapping, cheek biting, lip biting, and object biting.\r\nThese habits are different from functional activities that are controlled muscle activities such as chewing, speaking and swallowing.\r\nDEFINITIONS:\r\n\r\nAmerican Academy of Orofacial Pain defined bruxism as \u201cdiurnal or nocturnal parafunctional activity including clenching, bracing, gnashing, and grinding of the teeth.\u201d\r\nAmerican Sleep Disorders Association defined bruxism as \u201ctooth grinding or clenching during sleep plus one of the following: Tooth wear, sounds or jaw muscle discomfort in the absence of medical disorder.\u201d\r\nZarb and Carlsson defined bruxism as \u201cnocturnal clenching and grinding of teeth.\u201d\r\nClenching\r\n\r\nClenching of the teeth is defined as forceful closure of the opposing dentition in a static relationship of the mandible to the maxilla in either maximum intercuspation or an eccentric position.\r\n\r\nGrinding\r\n\r\nGrinding of the dentition is defined as forceful closure of the opposing dentition in a dynamic maxillomandibular relationship as the mandibular arch moves through various excursive positions."

                "CAUSES:\r\nThe causes of Bruxismare not completely clear. There is no single factor that is responsible for bruxism. Multiple causative factors of bruxism are:\r\n\r\nMorphological factors: dental occlusion and the anatomy of the jaws may be associated with bruxism.\r\nPsychosocial factors: Stress, anxiety and certain personality characteristics.\r\nSpecial neurotransmitters\r\nPatho-physiological factors such as diseases, trauma, genetics, smoking, alcoholism, caffeine intake, illicit drugs and medication.\r\nSleep disorders (sleep apnoea and snoring).\r\n\r\nAccording to Nadler and Meklas, causes of Bruxism are:\r\n\r\nLocal Factors: Mild occlusal disturbances, which produces mild discomfort to the patient. Unconscious attempts of an individual to establish a greater number of teeth in contact or to counteract a local irritating situation leads to bruxism.\r\nSystemic Factors: Gastrointestinal disturbances, subclinical nutritional deficiencies, and allergy or endocrinal disturbances have all been reported as significant causative factors, but their role is difficult to assess. Bruxism, sometimes may also be hereditary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychological Factors: It is believed to be the most common cause; but none of the studies published in the literature regarding the role of psychosocial factors in aetiology of bruxism is conclusive. It has been found to be associated with high levels of anxiety, stress, and emotional tension. In children, nervous tension manifests as and may be related to chronic biting or chewing of toys. Some studies suggest that sleep bruxism episodes are a part of sleep arousal response. Bruxing children are more anxious than non-bruxers. A multifactorial large scale population study about sleep bruxism revealed highly stressful life as a significant risk factor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOccupational Factors: Bruxism, sometimes present itself as an occupational habit. Certain occupations requiring precise work such as that of watchmaker, athletes engaged in physical activities favour the development of bruxism. Voluntary bruxism is also recognized in people who are habitual of chewing gum, tobacco, or objects such as tooth or pencils."

The cancer can spread to distant parts of the body through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. Not all tumours are cancerous.\r\nBenign tumours:These types of tumours do not grow uncontrollably or do not invade neighboring tissues. They do not spread throughout the body.\r\nThere are over 200 different known cancers that affect humans.Most of the cancers are named from where they start. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy."

When abnormal tissue or cancer is found early, it is easy to treat or cure. By the time symptoms appear, the cancer might have grown and spread. This can make the cancer harder to treat or cure. It is important to remember that when a doctor suggests any screening test, it does not always mean that there is a cancer. People with suspected cancer are investigated with medical tests. These tests include Blood tests, X-rays, MRIs, Biopsy, Pap-smears, CT scans and Endoscopy and many more."

Biopsy is normally required. It is typically an important part of establishing the definitive diagnosis and staging the tumour required. Localized cancer surgery typically attempts to remove the entire mass along with the lymph nodes in the region(in some cases).\r\nRadiation: Radiation therapy involves the use of ionizing radiation in an attempt to either cure or ameliorate the symptoms of cancer. It is used in about half of the cases and can be eitherfrom internal sources in the form of brachytherapy or external therapy.\r\nChemotherapy: Chemotherapy in addition to surgery has proven to be useful in a number of different cancer types including: breast cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, osteogenic sarcoma, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, and some lung cancers.\r\nStem cell transplants for treating cancer: Sometimes very high doses of chemotherapy are used, often with radiation therapy, in order to destroy the cancer cells. This treatment also kills the stem cells in the bone marrow. Soon after treatment, stem cells are replanted to replace those that were destroyed. These stem cells are given into a vein, much like a blood transfusion. Over time they settle in the bone marrow and begin to grow and make healthy blood cells. This process is called engraftment."

                "Chikungunya fever is a debilitating, but non-fatal, viral illness. It is spread by the bite of infected female Aedes aegypti mosquito. Aedes mosquito breeds in clean water collections. The water containers, tanks, discarded material such as buckets, utensils, tyres, flower-pots etc. are the breeding sites for these mosquitoes. The peak biting times of the Aedes aegypti mosquito are early morning or late evening. Chikungunya fever is caused by a virus of genus alphavirus in the family of togaviridae. It is diagnosed based on symptoms, physical findings (e.g. joint swelling), laboratory testing and the possibility of exposure to infected mosquitoes. There is no specific treatment for Chikungunya fever. The treatment is mainly supportive to ease the symptoms.\r\nNational Vector Borne Disease Control Programme\r\n\r\nChikungunya Fever"

These deposits can restrict blood flow to the heart muscle by clogging the artery. This result in reduced supply of blood to the heart, thus heart becomes starved of oxygen and the vital nutrients it requires to work properly. This can lead to chest pain called angina. If blood supply to a portion of the heart muscle is cut off entirely, or if the energy demands of the heart become much greater than its blood supply, a heart attack (injury to the heart muscle) may occur. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death for both men and women living in urban areas as compared to rural India."

                "Childhood exotropia (outward deviation) is a horizontal exodeviation characterised by visual axis forming a divergent angle. It usually begins as exophoria. Exophoria is a condition in which eyes are straight without deviation when both eyes are open. However, eye under cover deviates on cover-uncover test or alternate cover test. It may progress to exotropia which may be latent (exophoria) or manifest (Exotropia). Fluctuation between phoria and tropia is common in exotropia.\r\nClassification of childhood exotropia:\r\nIt is broadly classified as:\r\n\r\nIntermittent exotropia\r\n\r\nConstant exotropia:\r\nConstant exotropia may be of following types:-\r\n\r\nCongenital exotropia\r\nDecompensated intermittent exotropia\r\nSensory deprivation exotropia\r\nConsecutive exotropia\r\n\r\nAccording to distance-near relationships, exodeviations may be further subdivided as (Duane classification):-\r\nConvergence insufficiency exotropia: Due to convergence insufficiency, exotropia is worse for near vision.\r\nDivergence excess: Due to divergence excess, exotropia is worse for distance vision.\r\nBasic exotropia: Exotropia is equal for both near and distance vision.\r\nIntermittent exotropia:\r\nIntermittent exotropia frequently begins around the age of two years. A child with intermittent exotropia does not develop diplopia (double vision) due to bitemporal suppression, unlike acquired manifest exotropia in adults. With progressive suppression, constant exotropia may develop. Development of amblyopia (functional suppression of retina) is very rare. Manifest exotropia may be precipitated by factors such as fatigue, light glare, ill-health or visual distraction.\r\nCongenital exotropia:\r\nCongenital exotropia is rare and present at birth and may be associated with neurological abnormalities like cerebral palsy, midline defects or craniofacial syndromes. Infantile exotropia manifests during the first year of life.\r\nDecompensated intermittent exotropia:\r\nManifest intermittent exotropia may increase with time and become constant exotropia.\r\nSensory deprivation exotropia:\r\nSensory deprivation exotropia is due to disruption of binocular reflexes by acquired conditions like opaque media due to a disease or cataract. It begins in children over five years of age or in adults.\r\nConsecutive exotropia:\r\nConsecutive exotropia may develop following surgical overcorrection of esotropia (inward deviation of eyes), especially in an eye which is amblyopic. Occasionally, a deeply amblyopic convergent eye may become divergent (acquire resting position of eye).\r\nSecondary exotropia results from a primary sensory deficit (sensory deprivation exotropia) or occurs as a result of treatment for esotropia (consecutive exotropia)."

                "For diagnosis of childhood exotropia:-\r\nA complete eye examination is conducted including record of ocular motility.\r\nOcular deviation for gaze at near (33 centimeters), distance (6 meters) and far distance (beyond 6 meters) is recorded.\r\nAssessment of the control of deviation is noted which helps in monitoring progression of intermittent exotropia. This deviation may be noted by the parents or is detected on eye examination.\r\nThe degree of deviation may be different in primary (straight gaze) and lateral (side) gaze positions. This is important to record from surgical point of view, to avoid post operative diplopia in lateral gaze.\r\nIntermittent exotropia:\r\nPatients with intermittent exotropia rarely have any complaints due to well developed suppression mechanism. Patient may have symptoms like eyestrain, headache, blurring of vision or difficulty in prolonged reading. However, these symptoms are quickly controlled by development of sensory adaptation. Not all intermittent exotropias are progressive. The deviation may remain stable for many years. The patient should be followed over time to know whether exotropia is stable or deteriorating.\r\nCongenital Exotropia:\r\nIt is characterised by:\r\n-Fairly large and constant angle of deviation.\r\n-Since infant uses left eye in left gaze and right eye in right gaze (uncrossed homonymous fixation), development of amblyopia is uncommon. In some, if one eye is preferred for vision, then other eye may develop amblyopia.\r\n-Infant has normal refraction.\r\n- Adduction is not restricted.\r\n-No lid involvement or pupillary abnormalities distinguishing it from oculomotor nerve palsy ( third cranial nerve).\r\nDecompensated intermittent exotropia:\r\nIn some patients, exophoria progresses to intermittent exotropia that eventually may lead to constant exotropia. Deviations usually occur first for distance and later appear for near fixation. However, there are exceptions. The deviation remains constant or rarely may decrease.\r\nSensory deprivation exotropia:\r\nAn eye with poor vision (may be due to opaque media), or a blind eye drifts outwards into exodeviation. This usually occurs in children 2 to 4 years of age and in adults.\r\nConsecutive exotropia:\r\nDevelopment of consecutive exotropia, after correction of esotropia, may take many years. Usual factors for surgical overcorrection of esotropia are excessive amount of surgery, amblyopia, high hypermetropia, and poor preoperative evaluation of patient.\r\nExotropia should be distinguished from conditions like oculomotor nerve palsy or pseudoexotropia. In pseudoexotropia, visual axis of both eyes is straight, but the eyes appear divergent."

                "Nonsurgical methods of correction are adopted in children having good control of deviation as well as in those where risks of overcorrection are undesirable.\r\n- Correction of refractive errors: A trial of spectacle correction is given in all cases of refractive errors. Myopics, in particular, may control the deviation with glasses and may recover from intermittent exotropia.\r\n- Prescription of overcorrecting concave (minus) glasses: Overcorrecting concave lenses stimulate accommodative convergence and may improve quality of fusion. It may decrease the exotropia.\r\n- Part time occlusion: Part time occlusion of non deviating normal eye may treat suppression and amblyopia in deviating eye and thereby may correct exotropia and revert it to exophoria. Alternate occlusion of eyes may be done in cases showing equal preference. Part time occlusion has been found useful in very young children.\r\n-  Use of prisms: Base-in prisms enforce bifoveal stimulation and help in relieving eyestrain. Prisms may be used to improve fusional control.\r\n- Orthoptic treatment: Fusional convergence exercises may be employed in patients with symptoms of convergence insufficiency type of intermittent exotropia. Active anti-suppression and diplopia awareness techniques may be used in cases of suppression. Patient is encouraged to improve control on exotropia voluntarily.\r\n- Botulinum toxin chemodenervation: It may be difficult to achieve long term alignment in cases of secondary exotropias. Botulinum toxin injection in extraocular muscles may be used in patients with constant exotropia who are at risk of postoperative diplopia and also who have undergone multiple operations. Preoperatively, if after botulinum injection, a patient develops intractable diplopia, then he may be advised against surgical correction.\r\nIn sensory deprivation exotropia, management involves elimination or reversal of treatable causes like removal of cataract. Prisms and botulinum toxin denervation do not play a significant role in the management.\r\nSurgical management of exotropia:\r\nSurgical management may be indicated in patients with:\r\n- Poor control of intermittent exotropia: When manifest intermittent exotropia is present atleast half of the time during the day.\r\n-Progressive deterioration of control of intermittent exotropia: Patients with increase in size of deviation, loss of control and a progressive inability to re-fuse images after manifest deviation may be considered for surgery.\r\n- Severe eyestrain.\r\n- Troublesome diplopia.\r\n- Surgery may also be indicated to restore binocularity and also for cosmetic reasons. Surgical results are better for intermittent exotropia as compared to constant exotropia.\r\nSurgical management options include lateral rectus muscle recession, lateral rectus muscle recession with ipsilateral medial rectus muscle resection and bilateral medial rectus muscle resection.\r\nSurgery with preoperative conservative orthoptic or occlusion therapy gives the highest success rate.\r\nManagement of the disease should be under medical supervision."

                "Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF)\r\nCrimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral disease caused by tick-borne virus (Nairovirus). It is a zoonotic (could be transmitted from animals to humans) vector-borne disease. CCHF causes severe illness in humans and has a case-fatality rate of up to 40%.\r\nThe disease was first described in the Crimea (former USSR) in 1944 and given the name Crimean haemorrhagic fever. In 1969, it was recognized that the pathogen causing Crimean haemorrhagic fever was the same as that responsible for an illness identified in 1956 in the Congo and linkage of the both place names resulted in the current name for the disease and the virus.\r\nThe disease is widespread in many countries in Africa, Europe, Middle East and Central Asia with sporadic outbreaks recorded in Kosovo, Albania, Iran, and Turkey.\r\nIn India the first confirmed case of CCHF was reported during a nosocomial (Infections caught in hospitals) outbreak in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, in January 2011.Subsquently outbreaks were reported from different districts of Gujarat every year. During 2012\u20132015, several outbreaks and cases of CCHF transmitted by ticks via livestock and several nosocomial infections were reported in the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Cases were documented from 6 districts of Gujarat (Ahmadabad, Amreli, Patan, Surendranagar, Kutch, and Aravalli) and 3 districts of Rajasthan (Sirohi, Jodhpur, and Jaisalmer). A CCHF case was also reported from Uttar Pradesh state. Pakistan reports 50-60 cases annually.\r\nCCHF outbreaks constitute a threat to public health services because of its epidemic potential (biological capacity of a pathogen to cause disease in a particular environment), its high case fatality ratio (10-40%), its potential for nosocomial (hospital acquired infection) outbreaks and the difficulties in its treatment and prevention."

The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.\r\nHuman to human transmission- Humans can become infected if blood, body fluids and wastes from patients with the disease comes into contact with broken skin or mucous membranes, as occurs when medical care personnel sustain accidental needle stick injury. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles and contamination of medical supplies.\r\nIncubation periods-Incubation period depends on the mode of transmission of disease. It is usually one to three days when infected with tick bite with maximum nine days.\r\nThe incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually five to six days, with a documented maximum of 13 days.\r\nCCHF virus is highly infectious in the hospital settings.

It is not a simple smoker's cough, but an under-diagnosed, life threatening lung disease.\r\nAt one time, COPD was more common in men, but because of increased tobacco use among women in high-income countries and the higher risk of exposure to indoor air pollution (such as biomass fuel used for cooking and heating) in low-income countries, the disease now affects men and women almost equally.\r\nIf urgent action is not taken to reduce underlying risk factors, especially tobacco use and air pollution, then total deaths from COPD are projected to increase in next twenty years. According to WHO, COPD will move from fifth leading cause of death in 2002, to fourth place in the rank projected to 2030 worldwide."

                "Risk factors for COPD:\r\n(I) Genes: COPD is a polygenic disease.The genetic risk factor that is best documented is a severe hereditary deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin.\r\n(II)Environmental factors:\r\n(a)Tobacco smoke: The primary cause of COPD is tobacco smoke (including second-hand or passive exposure). Cigarette smoking is most commonly encountered risk factor for COPD. Apart from cigarettes, people from India smoke tobacco using bidis, hookahs and chillums among several other forms of smoking. Bidis are more harmful than cigarettes (although they contain only one fourth the amount of nicotine, they produce four to five times more tar than cigarettes, making one bidi as harmful as one cigarette), hookahs are more harmful than bidis and the chillum is the most harmful of the lot. Smoking during pregnancy may also pose a risk for the foetus, by affecting lung growth and development of the foetus.\r\nPassive exposure to cigarette smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke or ETS) may also contribute to respiratory symptoms and COPD.\r\n(b) Indoor air pollution: Biomass (wood, animal dung, crop residues) and coal are used as the main source of energy for cooking, heating, and other household needs by some communities. In these communities, indoor air pollution is responsible for a greater fraction of COPD risk than smoking or outdoor air pollution. The other common indoor air pollutant is the burning of mosquito coils at homes to get rid of mosquitoes. Burning one mosquito coil in the night emits as much particulate matter pollution, as that is equivalent to around 100 cigarettes.\r\n(c)Outdoor air pollution:Outdoor air pollution mainly from emission of pollutants from motor vehicles and industries is an important public health problem. High levels of urban air pollution are harmful to individuals with existing heart or lung disease.\r\n(d) Occupationaldusts and chemicals(such as vapours, irritants, and fumes)\r\n(e)Lung growth and Development-Any factor that affects lung growth during gestation and childhood has the potential for increasing an individual\u2019s risk of developing COPD.\r\n(f) Oxidative Stress(excess of oxidants and/or depletion of antioxidants are termed oxidative stress): An imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants is considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD.\r\n(g)Infections: Infections (viral and bacterial) may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. A history of severe childhood respiratory infection has been associated with reduced lung function and increased respiratory symptoms in adulthood. Tuberculosis is recognized as a risk factor for COPD.\r\n(h)Socioeconomic Status: There is evidence that the risk of developing COPD is inversely related to socioeconomic status. It is not clear, however, whether this pattern reflects exposures to indoor and outdoor air pollutants, crowding, poor nutrition, or other factors that are related to low socioeconomic status.\r\n(i)Nutrition:The role of nutrition as an independent risk factor for the development of COPD is unclear. Malnutrition and weight loss can reduce respiratory muscle strength and endurance, apparently by reducing both respiratory muscle mass and the strength of the remaining muscle fibers.\r\n(j)Asthma: Asthma may be risk factor for the development of COPD, although the evidence is not conclusive.\r\nThe causes for COPD have opposite patterns according to the geographic areas. In high- and middle-income countries tobacco smoke is the biggest risk factor, meanwhile in low-income countries exposure to indoor air pollution, such as the use of biomass fuels for cooking and heating, is the main risk factor."

It measures how much air a person can inhale and exhale, and how fast air can move into and out of the lungs. Because COPD develops slowly, it is frequently diagnosed in people aged 40 or older.\r\nWhere spirometry is unavailable, clinical symptoms and signs, such as abnormal shortness of breath and increased forced expiratory time, can be used to help with the diagnosis.\r\nChronic cough and sputum production often precede the development of airflow limitation by many years; although not all individuals with cough and sputum production go on to develop COPD."

                "An effective COPD management plan includes four components: (1) assess and monitor disease; (2) reduce risk factors; (3) manage stable COPD; (4) manage exacerbations.\r\nAssess and monitor disease:\r\nA clinical diagnosis of COPD should be considered in any patient who has dyspnoea, chronic cough or sputum production, and /or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease. The diagnosis should be confirmed by spirometry.\r\nReduce risk factors:\r\nTobacco smoke, occupational exposures, indoor and outdoor air pollution and irritants are various risk factors for COPD. Reductions of total personal exposure to these risk factors are important goals to prevent the onset and progression of COPD.\r\n(a)Tobacco smoke-\r\nHealth care workers should encourage all patients who smoke to quit, even those patients who come to the health care provider for unrelated reasons and do not have symptoms of COPD. Counseling delivered by physicians and other health professionals significantly increases quit rates over self-initiated strategies. Pharmacotherapy is recommended in persons when counseling is not sufficient to help patients quit smoking.\r\nThe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has launchedNational Tobacco Control Programmewith the objective to bring about greater awareness about the harmful effects of tobacco use. (www.nhp.gov.in/national-tobacco-control-programme)\r\nWith the involvement of mobile technologymCessation Programme- QUIT TOBACCO FOR LIFE\u201cis initiated to reach out and support the tobacco users of all categories who want to quit tobacco use. (www.nhp.gov.in/quit-tobacco-programme)\r\n(b)Occupational exposure -The main emphasis should be on primary prevention, which is best achieved by the elimination or reduction of exposures to various substances in the workplace. Secondary prevention, achieved through surveillance and early case detection, is also of great importance.\r\n(c) Indoor and outdoor air pollution-Reduction of exposure to smoke from biomass fuel, particularly among women and children, is a crucial goal to reduce the prevalence of COPD worldwide. Public policy to reduce vehicle and industrial emissions to safe levels is an urgent priority to reduce the development of COPD.\r\nManage stable COPD:\r\nThe overall approach to managing stable COPD should be individualized to manage symptoms and thereby improvement in the quality of life. The approach consists of health education, medications, pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, ventilatory support, surgical treatment.\r\n(i)Health education- For patients with COPD, health education can play a role in improving skills, ability to cope with illness, and health status. It is effective in accomplishing certain goals, including smoking cessation. Education also improves patient response to exacerbations.\r\n(ii)Pharmacologic treatment- Pharmacologic therapy is used to prevent and control symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, improve health status, and improve exercise tolerance.\r\na)Bronchodilators(medications that cause widening of airway) are given on an as-needed basis or on a regular basis to prevent or reduce symptoms.\r\nb)Glucocorticosteroids:The role of Glucocorticosteroids in the management of stable COPD is limited to specific indications.\r\nc)Other pharmacological treatments-\r\nVaccines- Influenza vaccines containing killed or live, inactivated viruses are recommended to COPD cases. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is recommended for COPD patients 65 years and older.\r\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation therapy- It may be used in young patients with severe hereditary alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and established emphysema.\r\nAntibiotics- antibiotics should be used for treating infectious exacerbations of COPD and other bacterial infections.\r\nMucolytic (mucokinetic, mucoregulator) agents-Although a few patients with viscous sputum may benefit from mucolytics, the overall benefits seem to be very small. Widespread use of these agents is not recommended. \r\nAntitussives-Cough, has a significant protective role, thus the regular use of antitussives is not recommended in stable COPD.\r\n(iii)Non-pharmacologictreatment-\r\na) Rehabilitation- Comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation programme includes exercise training, nutrition counseling, and education.\r\n\r\nExercise training- All patients with COPD benefit from exercise training programs, improving with respect to both exercise tolerance and symptoms of dyspnoea and fatigue.\r\n(b)Nutrition counseling- Nutritional state is an important determinant of symptoms, disability, and prognosis in COPD; both overweight and underweight can be a problem.\r\n\r\n(iv) Oxygen Therapy-Oxygen therapy, one of the principal non pharmacologic treatments for patients with Severe COPD. It can be administered in three ways: long term continuous therapy, during exercise, and to relieve acute dyspnoea.\r\nThe long-term administration of oxygen (&gt; 15 h per day) to patients with chronic respiratory failure has been shown to increase survival.\r\n(v)Ventilatory support- Noninvasive ventilation (using either negative or positive pressure devices) is now widely used to treat acute exacerbations of COPD.\r\n(vi)Surgical treatment-\r\n\r\nBullectomy,\r\nLung volume reduction surgery (LVRS),\r\nLung transplantation.\r\n\r\n(vii) Manage exacerbations:\r\nExacerbations of respiratory symptoms requiring medical intervention are important clinical phases in COPD. The most common causes of an exacerbation are infection of the tracheobronchial tree and air pollution, but the cause of approximately one-third of severe exacerbations cannot be identified.\r\nInhaled bronchodilators (particularly inhaled B2-agonists or anticholinergics), theophylline, and systemic, preferably oral, glucocorticosteroids are effective for treatments for acute exacerbations of COPD.\r\nPatients experiencing COPD exacerbations with clinical signs of airway infection (e.g., increased volume and change of color of sputum, or fever) may benefit from antibiotic treatment.\r\nNoninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in acute exacerbations improves blood gases and pH (a measure of acidity and alkalinity), reduces in-hospital mortality, decreases the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and intubation, and decreases the length of hospital stay."

On 7 January, Chinese authority identified a new type of coronavirus as a cause of pneumonia outbreak, which is different from any other human coronaviruses discovered so far. The new strain is named as 2019-nCoV. Afterwards on 11February 2020, this virus is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and disease is named as COVID-19 by World Health Organisation (WHO).\r\nTo date, other six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified. Out of these, four are globally circulated in the human population and contribute to approximately one-third of common cold infections in humans. The other two viruses are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS Coronavirus) causing severe respiratory diseases. Coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, are zoonotic, and can be transmitted from animals (civet cats and dromedary camels, respectively) to humans.\r\n(SARS-CoV was first reported in 2002-2003 in Guangdong, China and MERS coronavirus was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012).\r\nThe precise zoonotic (animal) origin of the 2019\u2011nCoV is still uncertain. The virus has been identified in environmental samples from a live animal market in Wuhan, China and some human cases have been epidemiologically linked to this market.\r\nEpidemiological evidence shows that 2019\u2011nCoV can be transmitted from one individual to another. In the previous outbreaks of other coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS, human-to-human transmission occurred most commonly through droplets, personal contact, and contaminated objects. The modes of transmission of 2019\u2011nCoV are similar.\r\nAccording to WHO, additional investigations are needed to determine how the patients were infected, the extent of human-to-human transmission, the clinical spectrum of disease, and the geographic range of infection.\r\nOn 30 January 2020, the Director-General of WHO declared the 2019\u2011nCoV outbreak a public health emergency of international concern under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005).\r\nCOVID-19 outbreak was declared as pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020.

                "Conjunctivochalasis (CCh) is defined as the presence of redundant non-oedematous conjunctiva that may be asymptomatic, or it may be symptomatic due to unstable tear film or mechanical disruption of tear flow. Conjunctivochalasis is usually found in older people and is often overlooked, and is classified as a normal variant of eye due to ageing. However, it has been seen in patients as early as first decade of life with an increase in prevalence and severity with age. It is usually bilateral condition and consists of an elevation of the bulbar conjunctiva over the lower lid margin, most commonly in the infero-temporal region. However, in addition to temporal region, it may involve bulbar conjunctiva along nasal, central lid-margin or any combination of these areas. The presence of loose redundant tissue causes disruption of inferior tear meniscus. This conjunctival prolapse may impede tear outflow through the inferior punctum, resulting in epiphora (watering from eyes). It may also involve upper bulbar area with loose conjunctiva, but it is less common.\r\nDescriptions of conjunctivochalasis were noted as early as 1908 by Elschnig. Braunschweig in 1921 and Wollenberg (1922) also described this condition. The term conjunctivochalasis was coined by W L Hughes in 1942. (Hughes WL. Conjunctivochalasis. Am J Ophthalmol 1942; 25: 48-51).They described more severe findings of CCh such as pain, subconjuntival haemorrhage and exposure keratopathy.

                "No true aetiology is known for conjunctivochalasis. Senile changes involving the subcutaneous, elastic or supporting tissue in the conjunctiva was suggested as the cause. Eye rubbing, mechanical irritation or trauma to conjunctiva, and abnormal eyelid position were all implicated.\r\nFrancis et al. based on clinical and histopathological study suggested that the development of CCh is multi-factorial, which includes local trauma, ultra-violet radiation and delayed tear clearance as inciting factors (Francis IC, Chan DG, Kim P, et al. Case- controlled clinical and histopathological study of conjunctivochalasis. Br J Ophthalmol 2005; 89:302-305).\r\nWatanabe et al. showed microscopic lymphangiectasia of the subconjunctiva without any inflammation. There was loss of typical fiber patterns with fragmented elastic fibers and sparse collagen fibers. They suggested that mechanical forces between the lower eyelid and conjunctiva gradually impaired lymphatic flow, resulting in lymphatic dilatation and clinical CCh (Watanabe A, Yokoi N, Kinoshita S, et al. Clinicopathologic study of conjunctivochalasis. Cornea 2004; 23:294-298).\r\nYokoi et al. by immunestaining, compared conjunctival samples of CCh patients with those of known normal and known inflammatory ocular surface disease and showed negligible role of inflammation in CCh (Yokoi N, Komuro A, Nishii M, et al. Clinical impact of conjunctivochalasis on the ocular surface. Cornea [Clinical Trial] 2005; 24(Suppl.8):S24-31).\r\nMore recent studies have suggested a mechanistic approach to the development of CCh. Mechanistic evidence suggests a shift in the normal balance of conjunctival matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). MMPs are enzymes that modify or degrade extracellular matrix, possibly contributing to the pathogenesis of CCh. MMP-1 and MMP-3 enzymes have been noted to be over-expressed in conjunctivochalasis fibroblasts in tissue culture, while enzyme levels of TIMPs are unchanged (Li DQ, Meller D, Liu Y, Tseng SC. Over-expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 by cultured conjunctivochalasis fibroblasts. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2000; 41: 404- 410). This interaction or change in balance of MMPs and their inhibitors, which normally participate in connective tissue degradation and remodelling, leads to clinically evident redundant conjunctiva observed in conjunctivochalasis."

                "CCh is one of the most common under diagnosed and misdiagnosed ocular surface disease. Non-specific symptoms along with intermittent findings of conjunctival oedema often lead to misdiagnosis. Due to fluctuation in findings of disease process, several clinical exams may be required to confirm the diagnosis. Diagnosis of CCh is mainly clinical.\r\nSlit lamp biomicroscopy (by an eye specialist) shows prolapsed or folds of conjunctiva in temporal, nasal or central part of lower lid-margin. Presence of redundant conjunctiva over lower lid margin suggests CCh. Prolapsed conjunctiva causes a disruption of tear movement and outflow through inferior lacrimal punctum resulting in epiphora.\r\nSigns on slit lamp examination are:\r\n\r\nPresence of redundant conjunctiva.\r\nAltered tear meniscus.\r\nDryness of eyes on Schirmer test.\r\nReduced tear film break up time (BUT).\r\nFluorescein sodium/ rose bengal dye stain shows conjunctival staining in non-exposure zone.\r\nInferior punctum blockage in nasal CCh, resulting in epiphora, in spite of normal and patent lacrimal passage.\r\nAnterior migration of muco-cutaneous junction caused by overspill of aqueous tears due to obliteration of tear meniscus.\r\nRegional lid-margin inflammation, again due to overspill of aqueous tears.\r\n\r\nPrior to correct diagnosis, patients with CCh are often diagnosed with more common ocular surface diseases, such as\r\n\r\nDry eye\r\nAnterior blepharitis\r\nMeibomian gland disease or\r\nAllergic eye conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nOften CCh is not considered a significant clinical entity, or significance of the conjunctival finding is not recognised.\r\n\r\nMany patients are first diagnosed when epiphora develops due to blocked puncta caused by redundant conjunctiva.\r\n\r\nGrading systems:\r\nH\u00f6h et al., looked at the number of lid-parallel conjunctival folds (LIPCOF) (H\u00f6h H, Schirra F, Kienecker C, et al. Lid-parallel conjunctival folds are a sure diagnostic sign of dry eye. Ophthalmologe 1995; 92: 802-808). They noted the number of LIPCOF had a high predictive value for diagnosis of keratoconjunctivitis sicca.\r\nAt present, the most widely used grading system was proposed by Meller and Tseng in 1998 who adapted the scale by H\u00f6h and associates, and included the extent of CCh, changes with down-gaze and digital pressure, and presence of punctal occlusion (Meller D, Tseng SCG. Conjunctivochalasis: literature review and possible pathophysiology. Surv Ophthalmol 1998; 43: 225-232).\r\nAccordingly, the grades of severity of conjunctivochalasis, based on the number of folds and their relationship to the tear meniscus height are:\r\n\r\nGrade 1: No persistent fold.\r\nGrade 2: Single, small fold.\r\nGrade 3: More than two folds and not higher than the tear meniscus.\r\nGrade 4: Multiple folds and higher than the tear meniscus.\r\n\r\nThe newest grading system proposed by Zhang et al. in 2011 further modified Meller and Tseng\u2019s approach by including three symptoms (epiphora, feeling of dryness, and foreign body sensation) and unstable tear film break-up time (BUT) (Zhang X, Li Q, Zou H, et al. Assessing the severity of conjunctivochalasis in a senile population: a community-based epidemiology study in Shanghai, china. BMC Pub Health 2011; 11:198). These modifications rule out asymptomatic, normal older people from the noted very high prevalence rates of CCh. The validity of this requires further studies.\r\n\r\nHistopathology:\r\nMost common histopathologic findings are elastosis or chronic non-granulomatous inflammation (Yanoff Myron, Sassani Joseph W. Ocular Pathology. Seventh Edition. Elsevier Saunders. 2015. P. 216.).\r\nMicroscopic lymphangiectasia is typically present.\r\n\r\nConjunctivochalasis should be differentiated from:\r\n\r\nDry eye syndrome: \r\n\r\nIn dry eye, symptoms are worse in the evening, aggravates in up-gaze, Fluorescein sodium/ rose bengal dye stains inter-palpebral exposure zone, increased blinking and punctal occlusion improves it.\r\nIn conjunctivochalasis, symptoms are same throughout the day, aggravates in down-gaze, Fluorescein sodium/rose bengal dye stains non-exposure zone, increased blinking and punctal occlusion worsens it, unlike dry eye disease.\r\n\r\nSj\u00f6gren syndrome.\r\nMeibomian gland dysfunction.\r\nConjunctival infection.\r\nConjunctival inflammation.\r\nChemosis of conjunctiva.\r\nEntropion."

Conjunctival resection is customised according to degree of conjunctival laxity. Sutures or fibrin glue is utilised for apposition. Complete involvement of bulbar conjunctiva may require 360 degrees of resection.\r\nConjunctival fixation to sclera: Conjunctival fixation to sclera may be done after excision of redundant conjunctiva.\r\nAmniotic membrane transplantation: Amniotic membrane transplantation has been described as a treatment with either suture fixation of the amniotic membrane or fixation through the use of fibrin glue. Since CCh is a condition of redundant conjunctiva, many feels that addition of tissue, such as amniotic membrane is not warranted.\r\nSuperficial thermocautery: Minimally invasive superficial thermocautery of the inferior conjunctiva, helps in CCh by improving conjunctival laxity. Cautery applied over redundant conjunctiva causes contraction of it to restore tear outflow.\r\n\r\nExtensive conjunctival resections should be avoided in order to minimise complications, such as contraction of fornices, cicatricial entropion, and restriction of extra-ocular movement.\r\nPrognosis:\r\nPrognosis is generally good when the correct treatment is adopted according to the symptom complex in each individual patient."

                "Conjunctival concretions (Conjunctival lithiasis) are small vascular, granular, yellowish-white deposits being produced due to conjunctival degeneration and are found in the sub-epithelium of palpebral conjunctiva and fornix (junction between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) in the elderly group or in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Deposits were found in patients as young as 20 years old, with the range of occurrence from 30-80 years old. Concretions appear as multiple tiny inclusion cysts containing yellowish-white deposits of inspissated mucous and degenerated epithelial debris including keratin. They are frequently discrete, but confluent concretions are not uncommon. In one study, no significant difference was found between the lacalisation on the upper and lower eyelids, right or left eye, and most of the concretions were superficial and hard, and mainly single. Associated dysfunction of meibomian glands was also noticed in some patients.\r\nA recent article has emphasised how patients with conjunctival concretions are potentially affected with dry eye disease.\r\nThey are usually idiopathic, but they have also been associated with:\r\n\r\nChronic atopic keratoconjunctivitis.\r\nFollowing post-trachomatous degeneration.\r\nSulphadiazine eye drop administration.\r\n\r\nDegenerations of the conjunctiva are common conditions that, in most cases, have relatively little effect on ocular function and vision.

Conjunctival degenerations may be associated with chronic irritation, dryness, or previous history of trauma.\r\nIdentification of corneal and conjunctival degenerations has improved with the use of confocal microscopy, immuno-histochemical staining, and genetic testing."

                "Congenital anomalies (birth defects) can be defined as structural or functional anomalies (e.g. metabolic disorders) that occur during intrauterine life and can be identified prenatally, at birth or later in life. Congenital anomalies are also known as birth defects, congenital disorders or congenital malformations. Congenital anomalies are the major cause of new born deaths within four weeks of birth and can result in long-term disability with a significant impact on individuals, families, societies and health-care systems.\r\nIn nearly 50% of cases the exact cause of congenital anomaly could not be identified, although there are some known risk factors which can be linked with the causation of malformation. Congenital anomalies can be caused by single gene defects, chromosomal disorders, multifactorial inheritance, environmental teratogens (an agent, which can cause a birth defect) and micronutrient deficiencies.\r\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2010, an estimated 270 000 deaths during the first 28 days of life were reported due to congenital anomalies globally.\r\nAccording to March of Dimes (MOD) global report on birth defects 7.9 million births (6% of total births) occur annually worldwide with serious birth defects and 94% of these births occur in the middle and low income countries. According to joint WHO and MOD meeting report, birth defects account for 7% of all neonatal mortality and 3.3 million under five deaths. \r\nThe prevalence of birth defects in India is 6-7% which translates to around 1.7 million birth defects annually. The common birth defects include congenital heart disease (8-10 per 1000 live births), congenital deafness (5.6-10 per 1000 live births), and neural tube defects (4-11.4 per 1000 live births) (March of Dimes report, 2006).\r\nSome birth defects are clinically apparent at birth; others may only be diagnosed later in life. The structural defect such as spina bifida is obvious at birth whereas haemophilia a functional defect (a bleeding disorder) is not usually obvious until infancy or childhood.\r\nThe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has addressed the problem with the implementation of various national health programmes. In 2013, National Child Health Screening and Early Intervention Services covered 30 health conditions of the children aged 0-18 years through various approaches.\r\nIndia Newborn Action Plan (INAP) formulated in September 2014, has integrated the approaches for the prevention and care of newborn with birth defects into primary health care, with an emphasis on maternal and child health. INAP is India\u2019s committed response to the Global Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) by WHO with a vision to eliminate preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths."

                "Approximately in 50 percent of birth defects a specific cause is not known. However, known causes can be divided broadly into two groups:\r\n\r\nPreconception causes are genetic and partially genetic, originating mostly before conception. Birth defects are due to abnormalities of the genetic material--chromosomes and genes including chromosomal abnormalities, single gene defects and multifactorial disorders (which are caused by the interaction of genes and the environment).\r\nPost-conception causes develop after conception, but before birth. Birth defect is caused by an intra-uterine environmental factor. This includes teratogens that interfere with normal growth and development of the embryo or foetus, mechanical forces that deform the foetus, and vascular accidents that disrupt the normal growth of organs.\r\n\r\nRisk factors-\r\nSocioeconomic and demographic factors:\r\n\r\nCongenital anomalies are more frequently seen among low income families and countries.\r\nAbout 94% of severe congenital anomalies occur in low- and middle-income countries due to poor access to sufficient and healthy food, increased exposure to various infections and alcohol (cause foetal alcohol syndrome) and insufficient health care delivery system.\r\nMaternal age: advanced maternal age increases the risk of chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome.\r\n\r\nGenetic factors:\r\nConsanguinity (when parents are related by blood) increases the prevalence of rare genetic congenital anomalies; it nearly doubles the risk for anomalies in first-cousin unions. Consanguinity rates in India vary from 1% to 4% in the northern region to 20-30% in the southern region (especially uncle niece marriage). Consanguineous marriage in Indian Muslim communities is 20-30%. Some ethnic communities (e.g. Ashkenazi Jews or Finns) have a comparatively high prevalence of rare genetic mutations, leading to a higher risk of congenital anomalies.\r\nInfections:                                                                                                                              Some Maternal infections during pregnancy can increase the risk of birth defects such as:\r\n\r\nRubella infection (German measles-a viral infection) to pregnant mother can result in to miscarriage, deafness, intellectual disability, heart defects and blindness in newborn.\r\nToxoplasmosis (disease caused by parasite found in soil) infection during pregnancy can cause birth defects such as hearing loss, vision problems and intellectual disability.\r\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs): such as syphilis, cytomegalovirus can cause serious birth defects.\r\nZika virus infection: during pregnancy can cause certain birth defects (microcephaly and other abnormalities).\r\n\r\nMaternal nutritional status and medical conditions:\r\n\r\nIodine deficiency, folic acid deficiency, excessive Vitamin A intake may affect the normal development of an embryo or foetus, for example, folic acid insufficiency increases the risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect.\r\nObesity, diabetes mellitus and seizure disorders may increase the risk of certain birth defects.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental factors:\r\nMaternal exposure to certain medications, psychoactive drugs, tobacco, radiation and pesticides during pregnancy may increase the risk of congenital anomalies in foetus or neonate. Working or living near, or in, waste sites, smelters or mines may also be a risk factor.\r\nCertain drugs when taken during pregnancy may cause birth defects; these drugs are called teratogenic drugs (Category \u2018X\u2019 drugs). Categories \u2018X\u2019 drugs are contraindicated during pregnancy. (Drugs are categorized into 5 categories according to the development of adverse effects on the foetus, category A, B, C, D and X.)\r\nFoetal age at drug exposure determines the foetal damage as:\r\n\r\nBefore the 20th day after fertilization: there is all-or-nothing effect, either killing the embryo or not affecting it at all.\r\nDuring organogenesis (between 20 and 56 days after fertilization):teratogenic effects may occur at this stage.\r\nAfter organogenesis (in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters): teratogenic effects are unlikely, but drugs may alter growth and function of normally formed fetal organs and tissues.\r\n\r\nEasy availability of drugs along with inadequate health services, intake of non-prescribed drugs and self-medication are some common problems."

Along with routine ultrasound other tests can be used for screening during the first trimester and the second trimester of pregnancy.\r\nAccording to maternal characteristics/risk factors appropriate screening method can be used:\r\nFirst trimester screening: is a combination of two tests performed between 11th and 13th weeks of pregnancy:\r\n\r\nNuchhal translucency test: with the help of ultrasound thickness of the area at the back of the neck (foetus) is measured. An increase in the thickness can be a sign of Down syndrome.\r\nFirst trimester blood test: high levels of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) hormone and low levels of pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) are related with certain birth defects.\r\n\r\nWhen during first trimester screening nuchhal translucency test and maternal blood tests are used together, they have a greater ability to determine the chances of foetus might have a birth defect, such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21) andtrisomy 18.\r\nSecond trimester screening: Second trimester screening tests are advised between 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nTriple screen test/ quad screening: The triple screen test is a maternal blood screening test that involvesthree specific substances: Alpha-fetoprotein test (AFP), human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), and estriol estimation. When a test forthe hormone inhibin A is added, it's called a quad screening.\r\nAnomaly Ultrasound: The ultrasound is used to know about different parameters of foetus and looks for any birth defects.\r\n\r\nThe integrated test (first trimester screening tests plus the quad screening in thesecond trimester) correctly finds Down syndrome in about most of the cases. If the results of first trimester screening tests are abnormal, genetic counseling is recommended. Additional testing such as amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, cell-free fetal DNA or other ultrasounds may be needed for accurate diagnosis.\r\nAmniocentesis: during pregnancy foetus is surrounded by amniotic fluid that can be used to detect genetic disorders in the foetus. It is not routinely advised to all pregnant women and is recommended in pregnancies with high risk factors for the congenital disorders, such as (pregnancies at advanced age) for Down syndrome, muscular dystrophy, sickle cell anaemia, thalassemia and cystic fibrosis.\r\nChorionic villus sampling (CVS): in this test cells from the chorionic villi (tissues from placenta) are examined for chromosomal disorders such as Down syndromes. CVS isn't routinely offered to all pregnant women. It's only advised for further diagnosis when antenatal screening tests/ routine ultrasound show abnormality.\r\nCell-free fetal DNA- It is a noninvasive prenatal screening that uses cell-free DNA from the plasma of pregnant women as a screening method for fetal aneuploidy. It can be used in women 35 years or older, ultrasonographic findings indicative of an increased risk of aneuploidy, women with a history of trisomy-affected offspring, and women with positive first-trimester or second-trimester screening test results.\r\nCordocentesis: also called percutaneous umbilical blood sampling, a small sample of the foetal blood is withdrawn from the umbilical cord for detection of foetal abnormalities after 17 weeks of pregnancy. It is an invasive diagnostic test. This test detects chromosome abnormalitiesand certain blood disorders.\r\nGenetic services: There are 77 genetic counseling centers, 78 laboratories, and 37 prenatal diagnostic centers in India as listed on the national website*."

                "Cervical cancer\r\nCancer is the uncontrolled growth of body cells and can start almost anywhere in the human body. When cancer develops in the cervix of female it is termed as cervical cancer or cancer cervix. Cervix is the lower part of the uterus and connects the body of the uterus to the vagina (birth canal).The lower part of the cervix (ectocervix) lies within the vagina and the upper two thirds of the cervix (endocervix) lies above the vagina. Most cervical cancers originate in the area where the endocervix and ectocervix join.\r\nCervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide and second most common cancer in women living in less developed regions. World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 530 000 new cases of cervical cancer globally (estimations for 2012), with approximately 270 000 deaths (representing 7.5% of all female cancer deaths). More than 85% of these deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries.\r\nThe highest estimated incidence rates for cervical cancer are in sub-Saharan Africa, Melanesia, Latin America and the Caribbean, south-central Asia and south-east Asia.\r\nIndia has a population of 436.76 million women aged 15 years and older who are at risk of developing cervical cancer. Every year 122844 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 67477 die from the disease (estimations for 2012). In India cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women and also the second most common cancer among women between 15 and 44 years of age.\r\nNearly all cases of cervical cancer can be attributable to Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV is a group of viruses and one of the causative agents in the sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in men and women with and without clinical lesions. HPV types (16 and 18) cause 70% of cervical cancers and precancerous cervical lesions worldwide.\r\nBased on Indian studies about 82.7% of invasive cervical cancers showed the presence of HPVs 16 or 18 (Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literatures by ICO HPV Information Centre)*.\r\nOther epidemiological risk factors for cervical cancer are early age at marriage, multiple sexual partners, multiple pregnancies, poor genital hygiene, malnutrition, use of oral contraceptives, and lack of awareness.\r\nIndia also has the highest (age standardized) incidence rate as 22 (per 100,000 women per year) of cervical cancer in South Asia (estimations for 2012), compared to 19.2 in Bangladesh, 13 in Sri Lanka, and 2.8 in Iran.\r\nCervical cancer can be prevented by vaccinating all young females against the HPVs and by screening and treating precancerous lesions in women. In addition if cervical cancer is detected early and treated in earlier stages it can be cured."

                "Most of the cervical cancer and HPV infections in the early stages show no clinical signs and symptoms; precancerous lesions and early cancers can be detected by screening tests.\r\nScreening for cervical cancer-There are 3 different types of screening tests:\r\n\r\nConventional (Pap) test and liquid-based cytology (LBC) - The Pap test is used to detect abnormal cells that may develop into cancer if left untreated. In a conventional Pap test, the specimen (or smear) is placed on a glass microscope slide and a fixative is added. In an automated liquid-based Pap cytology test, cervical cells collected with a brush or other instrument are placed in a vial of liquid preservative. One advantage of liquid-based testing is that the same cell sample can also be tested for the presence of high-risk types of HPV, a process known as \u201cPap and HPV co-testing.\r\nVisual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) - Doctor may apply a dilute acetic acid solution (vinegar solution) to the cervix, which causes abnormal areas to turn white. Further a biopsy can be taken from abnormal area.\r\nHPV testing for high-risk HPV type- HPV testing is used to look for the presence of high-risk HPV types in cervical cells.\r\n\r\nScreening is recommended for every woman from aged 30 to 49 years at least once in a lifetime and ideally more frequently (WHO). Women living with HIV are advised to follow a different screening schedule.\r\nWomen who test negative with VIA or cytology, re-screening is advised at an interval of three to five years; whereas women who test negative with HPV testing, re-screening should be done after a minimum interval of five years.\r\nIf cancer is suspected in women during screening, they should be referred to a facility for diagnosis and treatment of cancer.\r\nWomen who screen positive for cervical pre-cancer can be treated with Cryotherapy or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) and should receive post-treatment follow-up after 12 months.\r\n\r\nDiagnostic tests for detection of cervical pre-cancer: some times, a diagnostic test is used for definitive diagnosis or confirmation of pre-cancer or cancer subsequent to positive screening results. Colposcopy, biopsy and endocervical curettage (ECC) are the commonly used diagnostic tests for cervical pre-cancer.\r\n\r\nColposcopy is the examination of the cervix, vagina and vulva with an instrument called colposcope. It is used in patients with positive screening results.\r\nBiopsy is the removal of small sample of abnormal tissue for microscopic examination. Biopsies can be taken from areas of the cervix that are VIA-positive or from areas that appear suspicious for cancer.\r\nEndocervical curettage (ECC) is a simple procedure in which some surface cells are gently scraped from the endocervical canal with a special thin instrument or spatula and examined under microscope. An endocervical cytobrush specimen may also be used for examination.\r\n\r\nCervical cancer stages-\r\n\r\nStage 0: The cancer is found only in the first layer of cells lining the cervix, not in the deeper tissues. The tumor is called carcinoma in situ and not considered to be an invasive cancer.\r\nStage I:The cancer has spread from the cervix lining into the deeper tissue but is still just found in the uterus. It has not spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body.\r\nStage II:The cancer has spread beyond the cervix to nearby areas, such as the vagina or tissue near the cervix, but it is still inside the pelvic area. It has not spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body.\r\nStage III:The cancer has spread outside of the cervix and vagina but not to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body.\r\nStage IV: The disease has spread to nearby organs or other parts of the body."

It is a zoonotic (could be transmitted from animals to humans) vector-borne disease. CCHF causes severe illness in humans and has a case-fatality rate of up to 40%.\r\nThe disease was first described in the Crimea (former USSR) in 1944 and given the name Crimean haemorrhagic fever. In 1969, it was recognized that the pathogen causing Crimean haemorrhagic fever was the same as that responsible for an illness identified in 1956 in the Congo and linkage of the both place names resulted in the current name for the disease and the virus.\r\nThe disease is widespread in many countries in Africa, Europe, Middle East and Central Asia with sporadic outbreaks recorded in Kosovo, Albania, Iran, and Turkey.\r\nIn India the first confirmed case of CCHF was reported during a nosocomial (Infections caught in hospitals) outbreak in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, in January 2011.Subsquently outbreaks were reported from different districts of Gujarat every year. During 2012\u20132015, several outbreaks and cases of CCHF transmitted by ticks via livestock and several nosocomial infections were reported in the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Cases were documented from 6 districts of Gujarat (Ahmadabad, Amreli, Patan, Surendranagar, Kutch, and Aravalli) and 3 districts of Rajasthan (Sirohi, Jodhpur, and Jaisalmer). A CCHF case was also reported from Uttar Pradesh state. Pakistan reports 50-60 cases annually.\r\nCCHF outbreaks constitute a threat to public health services because of its epidemic potential (biological capacity of a pathogen to cause disease in a particular environment), its high case fatality ratio (10-40%), its potential for nosocomial (hospital acquired infection) outbreaks and the difficulties in its treatment and prevention."

CCHF virus is stable for up to 10 days in blood kept at 400 C.\r\nVector (living organisms that can transmit infectious diseases between humans or from animals to humans) - The common vector of CCHF is the member of Hyalomma genus, the family Ixodidae. These are hard ticks and suck blood from animals and humans. Both male and female ticks can act as a vector for disease transmission.\r\nCCHF virus may infect a wide range of wild animals and domestic ruminant animals such as hares, rats, camel, cattle, sheep and goats.\r\nEnvironmental factors: Ecological changes, poverty, social instability, poor health services, and absence of standard infection control practices have contributed to increased transmission of the CCHF virus.\r\nMode of transmission-\r\nAnimal to human transmission-CCHF virus may be transmitted to human either by bite of hard tick or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians.\r\nHuman to human transmission- Humans can become infected if blood, body fluids and wastes from patients with the disease comes into contact with broken skin or mucous membranes, as occurs when medical care personnel sustain accidental needle stick injury. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles and contamination of medical supplies.\r\nIncubation periods-Incubation period depends on the mode of transmission of disease. It is usually one to three days when infected with tick bite with maximum nine days.\r\nThe incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually five to six days, with a documented maximum of 13 days.\r\nCCHF virus is highly infectious in the hospital settings. Nosocomial (hospital acquired) infections are common after exposure to blood and secretions of infected persons."

                "Chemical Injuries to the Eye constitutes an ophthalmic emergency, due to the potential for permanent visual impairment and threat to the structural integrity of the eye. Severe injury may result in widespread damage to the ocular surface epithelium.\r\nChemical injuries cause tissue destruction created from a wave of strongly dissociated ions flooding the eyelid and/or tear film and reservoir, penetrating the cornea and adjacent tissues, thereby reaching to the aqueous humour. Immediate shrinkage of the collagenous envelope of the eye results in a rapid rise in intraocular pressure, followed by a second rise which lasts longer and is produced by prostaglandin release. At any time, rise in pressure can occur due to clogging of the trabecular meshwork by necrotic debris, and from organisation of inflammatory components, followed by cicatricial closure of the chamber angle, especially inferiorly.\r\nInflammatory cells, most importantly, neutrophils, pour into the damaged tissue, releasing superoxide radicals and tissue degrading enzymes. There may be development of corneal ulcerations, perforations, and vascularisation.\r\nResponsible chemicals producing injury are numerous and include cleaning agents, fertilisers, refrigerants, cement, preservatives and fireworks. Alkali injuries occur more frequently than acid injuries, due to alkalis being more commonly present in household and industrial products. Ocular burns caused by detergents and thermal agents are less common.\r\nFortunately, the majority of chemical injuries are classified as mild. Injured patients are usually young, male and exposure most commonly occurs in a variety of agricultural, industrial and domestic settings, or less commonly in association with a criminal assault. Unfortunately, there is a rise in number of patients presenting with chemical eye injuries resulting from assault.\r\nThe final visual prognosis is influenced by the nature of the chemical insult, the extent of ocular damage, and the timing and efficacy of treatment.\r\nRegarding terminology, the literature is full with expressions like alkali \u2018burns\u2019, potentially confusing the alkali-injury terminology with a, usually non-existent, thermal, or even open flame component. When both chemical and thermal injuries occur simultaneously, the terms \u2018alkali-thermal injury\u2019 or \u2018thermal-alkali injury\u2019 might be used, with the most prominent injurious agent stated first. Acid injuries should be referred to in a similar way."

                "More than 25,000 chemical products with the potential to cause chemical eye injuries have been identified, many of which may be classified as acids or bases, oxidising or reducing agents, or corrosives. Acids and bases are the most frequently implicated chemical agents. The severity of the injury is related to the nature, concentration, quantity and pH of the chemical involved. It also depends upon the duration of contact and surface area of exposure. History of high-velocity (explosive) chemical injury should always raise suspicion of an associated intraocular foreign body.\r\nCausative agents of chemical injury are:\r\nAlkalis:\r\nMost common causes of alkali injury to the eye are lye, potassium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, lime, wet/dry cement and ammonia. Most severe injuries are typically caused by ammonia and lye which are both capable of rapid penetration into the eye. The severity of the injury is dependent on the anion concentration, the dissociation of the alkali, and the quantity of fluid. A wave of hydroxyl ions rapidly advances through ocular tissues, causing massive cell death by saponification of cellular membranes and extensive hydrolysis of glycosa-aminoglycans and collagen within the corneal matrix. Damage caused by lime injuries is reduced by the precipitation of calcium soaps that hinders further penetration. Presence of magnesium hydroxide in fireworks results in a combined chemical and thermal injury.\r\nThe most important agents causing alkali injuries to the eye are:\r\n\r\nAmmonia (NH3): Ammonia (NH3) is available as a fertiliser and refrigerant, and is used in the manufacture of other chemicals. Ammonium hydroxide ranks high in severity in causing injuries to eyes. It is commonly used as a household cleansing agent. Even 7% solution of ammonia is capable of causing major ocular damage, due to its high solubility and penetrability.\r\nLye: Lye, caustic soda or sodium hydroxide (NaOH), penetrates into the interior of the eye in 3-5 minutes. Solid sodium hydroxide, often used as a drain cleaner, can cause pressure to develop within the drainpipe, resulting in an explosion of lye into the face and eyes. Warmed lye is also commonly used to straighten curly hair. Caustic soda is also used in the manufacture of pulp, paper, textiles and soaps. Due to easy availability in home, it is a common chemical being used by paramours during attack. Lye injuries rank second in severity to those produced by ammonium hydroxide.\r\nPotassium hydroxide (KOH): Potassium hydroxide (KOH) or caustic potash penetrates the eye slightly less rapidly than sodium hydroxide. Dissolution of potassium hydroxide in water is strongly exothermic (produces heat) and it is corrosive.\r\nMagnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2): Magnesium hydroxide(Mg(OH)2) also penetrates the eye slightly less rapidly than sodium hydroxide. Magnesium hydroxide is found in sparklers and flares; the combination of thermal injury and chemical injury accounts for more severe injury than that being produced by either type alone.\r\nLime (Ca(OH)2): Lime, fresh lime or quicklime, calcium hydrate, plaster, cement , mortar and whitewash penetrates the eye less rapidly because it reacts with epithelial cell membranes, forming calcium soaps that precipitate and hinder further penetration. Lime, found in cement and plaster, is the most common cause of alkali injury. Retained particulate matter provides sump for on-going injury. Despite this, these injuries can be quite severe, with the corneal opacity visible before the opacity in case of ammonium or sodium hydroxide.\r\nMethyl ethyl ketone peroxide: Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide is a catalyst, and commonly used in various industries. It can cause both immediate and delayed corneal injury. There may be exacerbations and remissions of limbal and corneal disease lasting for more than twenty years.\r\n\r\nAcids:\r\nWeak acidic compounds precipitate proteins within the corneal and conjunctival epithelium, thus acting as a partial barrier to further penetration of the chemical. It leaves a greyish white epithelium, which often obscures all tissue underneath it. Stripping off this opacified epithelium often reveals a relatively clear underlying corneal stroma. As long as the corneal stem cells near the limbus are not damaged, epithelial recovery is likely, with little or no stromal cloudiness.\r\nHydrofluoric, sulphuric, sulphurous, chromic, and hydrochloric acids are the most common causes of acid burns. Strong acids ionise completely in an aqueous solution. The strength of an acid depends on its ability to dissociate and lose a proton. The primary mechanism of damage by acids is due to the action of dissociated proton. Hydrofluoric acid causes most severe acid injury due to its unique properties. Hydrofluoric acid has a unique dissolving action which allows it to quickly penetrate into deeper tissues. Moreover, hydrofluoric acid chelates all calcium and magnesium from cells, thereby halting cellular biochemical activity.\r\nAlthough alkalis typically cause the most serious chemical injuries, the presence of an acid injury does not preclude an equally severe ocular injury. Very strong acids, however, overcome this precipitated obstacle and progress through tissue, much as alkalis. Indeed, there is no clinically significant difference in course of injury and prognosis between severe acid and alkali burns. The end result of a very severe acid injury is often indistinguishable from that of an alkali injury.\r\nThe most important agents causing acid injuries to the eye are:\r\n\r\nHydrofluoric acid or hydrogen fluoride (HF): Hydrofluoric acid or hydrogen fluoride (HF) is a weak inorganic acid but a strong solvent, widely used in industries. HF is used in polishing and etching of glass and silicone, in the pickling or chemical milling of metals, and in the refining of uranium, tantalum, and berrylium. In the semiconductor industry it is essential in the manufacture of silicon chips.\r\n\r\nHF produces severe ocular injury because of its high degree of activity in dissolving cellular membranes. It chelates calcium/ magnesium ions and penetrates rapidly due to its low molecular weight. It is highly toxic so that as little as 7 ml of HF, or 2.5% burn of the body surface, is sufficient to cause death from uncontrolled hypocalcaemia.\r\nIt is found either in pure form or mixed with agents like nitric acid, ammonium difluoride, and acetic acid.\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid (H2SO4): Sulphuric acid is commonly used in batteries and also as industrial chemical. The most common cause of acid burns is sulphuric acid. Sulphuric acid produces injuries varying in degree from mild to very severe. Most of the injuries, especially the more severe ones, occur as a result of battery explosions. Hydrogen and oxygen are produced by electrolysis when sulphuric acid combines with water in the battery. This gaseous mixture explodes on contact with flame. Matches or cigarette lighters used as illumination sources or sparks produced by jumper cables are the most common modes of ignition. Injuries that result from battery explosions are usually combination of acid burn and contusion from particulate matter, but may also show laceration or intraocular foreign body penetration.\r\n\r\nInjury with sulphuric acid may be compounded by thermal burns from heat generated by the reaction of acid with water on the corneal tear film. Dissolution of concentrated sulphuric acid in water results in release of heat, which causes tissues charring.\r\n\r\nSulphurous acid (H2SO3): Sulphur dioxide (SO2) forms H2SO3 when it combines with water in the eye. It may be present as sulphurous anhydride or sulphurous oxide; a fruit and vegetable preservative, bleach, and refrigerant. Sulphurous acid denatures protein and inactivate various enzymes. Sulphurous acid penetrates the tissue easily, because it is highly soluble in lipid and water.\r\n\r\nAt first, visual acuity is not severely affected after exposure to sulphurous acid, but it worsens greatly over hours to days as the ocular condition deteriorates.\r\n\r\nHydrochloric acid (HCl): Hydrochloric acid (present in gastric juices as well) is used in household cleaning and in production of plastics. Fumes of hydrogen chloride gas, act as irritant to the eye and produce profuse tearing which serves to limit ocular damage. At high concentrations and with prolonged exposure, liquid HCl produces severe ocular damage.\r\nNitric acid (HNO3): Injuries produced by nitric acid (HNO3) are similar to those produced by HCl, except that the opacity in epithelium produced by nitric acid is yellowish rather than white, as it is in other types of acid burns.\r\nChromic acid: Chromic acid is a strong agent derived from chromic oxide and chromium trioxide. Ocular injuries caused by chromic acid result from exposure to droplets of the acid in the chrome-plating industry. It produces chronic conjunctival inflammation and a brown discolouration of the epithelium, in the exposed interpalpebral fissure.\r\nAcetic acid (CH3COOH): Acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a relatively weak organic acid, and is also known as vinegar and glacial acetic acid. The various forms of acetic acid, especially vinegar, typically produce only minor ocular damage, unless exposure is prolonged. Exposure to a solution in strength more than10% produces severe injury due to corrosive action, unless the time of exposure is exceedingly short. \u2018Essence of vinegar\u2019 (80% acetic acid) and glacial acetic acid (90%) are the most concentrated forms of acetic acid, and most likely to produce severe ocular injury.\r\n\r\nOther toxic chemicals: \r\nOther types of ocular chemical injuries are usually less severe than alkali and acid injuries.\r\nLacrimatory agents: Lacrimatory agents are aerosol dispersed chemicals which produce ocular irritation.\r\nCommon lacrimatory agents are:\r\n\r\nTear gas: Common agents used in tear gas are chloroacetophenone, chlorobenzylidene nalononitrile or dibenzoxazepine. Tear gas is used in riot control. Exposure to these chemicals causes ocular stinging, pain, excessive watering and inability to open eyes.\r\nChemical Mace (nonlethal spray containing purified tear gas and chemical solvent): Chemical Mace and similar compounds can cause minor to severe ocular injury, depending on a number of factors. The ocular injury associated with the original Chemical Mace is caused by the lacrimator chloroacetophenone.Degree of severity depends upon proximity of spray can to the eye, quantity of chemical entering the eye, duration of exposure, state of normal reflex mechanisms, and the mechanism of propelling the chemical.Extensive exposure leads to damage including loss of ocular surface epithelium, severe persistent stromal oedema, presumably secondary to endothelial damage, stromal clouding, and corneal neovascularisation.\r\n\r\nPepper spray (Oleoresin capsicum): Pepper spray (Oleoresin capsicum) is used for riot control or self defence. Exposure to these chemicals causes ocular stinging, pain, excessive watering and inability to open eyes.\r\nMustard gas (Dichlorodiethyl sulphide): Mustard gas (Dichlorodiethyl sulphide) is a poisonous agent used as a chemical warfare agent. It causes irritation of conjunctiva and sore sticky eyes on exposure or a chronic and delayed mustard gas keratitis manifesting as recurrent corneal erosions.\r\n\r\nChemicals and Festivals in India:\r\nHoli: The colourful festival of Holi is celebrated in Phalgun month of Indian calendar, which falls in February end or month of March, every year. It is also known as festival of colours. Instead of using natural colours, people mix harmful chemicals in colours. Most of these chemical colours are oxidised metals or industrial dyes mixed with inferior quality oil e.g. engine oil. Many water colours have an alkaline base which is harmful.\r\nChemicals used to impart different colours may be:\r\n\r\nCopper sulphate: It imparts green colour.\r\nChromium iodide: It imparts purple colour.\r\nAluminium bromide: It produces white to yellowish red shade to the colour.\r\nMercury sulphide: Mercury sulphide gives red colour.\r\nPowdered glass: Powdered glass is used to produce shiny colour.\r\n\r\nDiwali (Deepavali): Diwali is an important Indian festival celebrated by lighting lamps and bursting crackers. Diwali festival also marks end of Ashwin and beginning of Kartik month of Indian calendar and it falls in the month of October or November. The chemicals released by the firecrackers are harmful.\r\nChemical in firework includes:\r\n\r\nSulphur dioxide.\r\nCadmium.\r\nCopper.\r\nLead.\r\nMagnesium.\r\nNitrate.\r\nNitrite.\r\n\r\nMagnesium hydroxide is found in sparklers and flares. The combination of thermal and chemical injury accounts for more severe injury.\r\nFirecrackers release chemical pollutants such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.\r\n\r\nPathophysiology:\r\nAlkalis:\r\nThe severity of an ocular chemical injury is determined by the ability of the chemical to penetrate the eye. Alkalis, characteristically, penetrate the eye more rapidly than acids.\r\nThe hydroxyl anion (OH) saponifies plasma membranes, resulting in cell disruption and death, while the cation is responsible for the penetration by the alkali. Stronger alkalis are associated with more rapid penetration and the penetration rate increases in ascending order from calcium hydroxide, Potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide to ammonium hydroxide. Changes in aqueous humour pH are observed within a few seconds of contact with ammonium hydroxide and within 3-5 minutes after sodium hydroxide injury. Irreversible tissue damage occurs when the pH rises above 11.5.\r\nIn injuries with alkalis, cations react with the carboxyl (COOH) groups of stromal collagen and glycosa-aminoglycans. Hydration of glycosa-aminoglycans results in loss of clarity of the stroma, whereas, hydration of collagen fibrils causes distortion of trabecular meshwork and the release of prostaglandins, these sequelae combine to produce rise in intraocular pressure (IOP).\r\nAcids:\r\nIn general, acids penetrate the corneal stroma much less readily than alkalis. The hydrogen ion mediates damage due to pH alteration, while the anion causes precipitation and denaturation of proteins in the corneal epithelium and anterior stroma. Precipitation of the epithelial proteins produces a degree of protection by providing a physical barrier against further penetration. However, when an acid penetrates the stroma, the damage to ocular structures is similar to that observed in alkali injury.\r\nAcid injury produces:\r\n\r\nPrecipitation of extracellular glycosa-aminoglycans.\r\nCorneal opacification.\r\nDistortion of the trabecular meshwork.\r\nChanges in anterior chamber pH.\r\nDamage to anterior chamber structures.\r\nReduced aqueous ascorbate levels.\r\nVascular damage resulting in ischaemic injury.\r\n\r\nBoth acids and bases may mediate osmolar damage to the cornea. Chemical damage may initiate large changes in osmolarity, which gives rise to cellular dysfunction and destruction. There is little protection against a variety of chemical and toxic insults due to limited buffering capacity of the cornea. In the event that the buffering capacity is exceeded, there is an immediate cessation of biochemical activity e.g. protein synthesis.\r\nInjury, repair and differentiation:\r\nOcular surface:\r\nFollowing injury, recovery is dependent upon centripetal migration of cells from the most proximal region of viable epithelium. The extent of the injury determines the source of regenerating epithelium. Epithelial defect involving small area, or the entirety of cornea are replenished by adjacent corneal epithelium and limbus, respectively. In the event of complete corneal and limbal epithelial loss, the conjunctiva is the only source of regenerating epithelium. The source of regenerating epithelium influences the rate of re-epithelialisation and the type of restored epithelium.\r\nFactors retarding rate of re-epithelialisation, following chemical injury:\r\n\r\nRobust and persistent inflammatory response.\r\nStructural damage to the epithelial basement membrane.\r\n\r\nNon-healing corneal epithelial wounds pose a significant risk as they expose the cornea to potential microbial infection.\r\nStroma:\r\nSevere chemical injuries deplete stromal keratocytes, and initiate collagenolytic process which degrade collagen fibrils. These processes disrupt structural integrity and may result in corneal ulceration and perforation. Keratocytes are important for maintenance and regeneration of the corneal stroma. Following corneal injury, keratocytes migrate into areas of damaged stroma from adjacent tissue. Keratocytes are responsible for collagen synthesis. Collagen production is maximal between days 7 and 56, with a peak at about day 21 after injury. Collagen synthesis requires ascorbate and thus, may be significantly impaired following severe chemical injury.\r\nInflammation:\r\nChemical injury to the eye is associated with release of inflammatory mediators and the infiltration of inflammatory cells into injured tissue. Regulation of this inflammatory response is crucial, since a robust and prolonged inflammatory response may affect wound healing.\r\nSevere chemical injuries are characterised by two waves of inflammation; the first wave occurs in the first 24 hours and the second wave begins at approximately 7 days and peaks 2 to 3 weeks after injury. The intensity of the first wave may be critical for the recruitment of the second wave. The second wave of inflammation coincides with the period of maximal corneal degradation and repair, and may facilitate sterile enzymatic digestion of the corneal stroma. Sterile ulceration is associated with the infiltration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes. The exclusion of inflammatory cells from the corneal stroma is associated with cessation of sterile ulceration."

Eye must be irrigated to bring the pH to a safer range between 7 and 7.2.\r\nEarly assessment includes careful documentation of the extent and severity of limbal, corneal and bulbar/ palpebral conjunctival involvement, since it provides baseline reference in subsequent evaluation and treatment.\r\nPalpebral fissures should be examined and fornices should be swept to remove a retained particulate matter, which can cause persistent damage. Eye should be examined under fluorescein dye. Intraocular pressure should be documented as well to exclude any rise.\r\nEmergency treatment of the chemically injured eye must precede any attempt at classification. Once the condition has been stabilised, determine the anticipated course of the chemical injury by examining the critical features.

Photographic documentation may be obtained, if possible.\r\n\r\nClinical grading of chemical Injuries:\r\nEpithelial defect: Measure the size and draw the shape of the defect after instilling 2% fluorescein dye. Include any conjunctival epithelial defects as well, particularly concerning the palisades of Vogt (limbal stem cells). Document all epithelial defects, including those extending into the fornices of the eye.\r\nCorneal stromal opacity: Grade corneal stromal opacity on the basis of penlight examination:\r\n\r\nGrade 0: Grade 0 is clear cornea.\r\nGrade 1: Grade 1 has mild corneal haze.\r\nGrade 2: Grade 2 represents mild to moderate opacity.\r\nGrade 3: Grade 3 has moderate opacity.\r\nGrade 4: Grade 4 represents moderate to severe opacity. Details of iris trabeculae can be seen and pupils are visible.\r\nGrade 5: Grade 5 severe corneal opacity, pupils are not visible with penlight.\r\n\r\nPerilimbal ischaemia: To document perilimbal ischaemia, note the clock hours where the conjunctiva is whitened. The conjunctiva and episclera are devoid of blood vessels in these areas. This whitening should not be confused with less severe injury, where there is chemosis and thrombosed blood vessels, but some of the conjunctiva is still viable. Perilimbal whitening is a useful parameter by which the extent of corneal stem cell damage, and indirectly, injury of the underlying ciliary body and trabecular meshwork, may be judged. Documentation of these findings allows for more accurate determination of the necessity for corneal stem cell transplantation.\r\nAdnexa: Measure and document the blinking pattern, corneal exposure, and/or lagophthalmos.\r\nThese measurements and findings can be applied to the classification of alkali injuries as described by Hughes, and later modified by Ballen (1963), Roper- Hall (1965) and Pfister et al (1982). This classification, with accompanying drawings and photographs, represents the span of damage encountered after alkali injury. The accuracy of early assessment becomes important in prognostication and treatment plans.\r\n\r\nClassification of chemical injury to the eye:\r\nDua (2001) provides a classification of ocular surface burns giving prognosis based on corneal appearance, conjunctival involvement and analogue scale recording the amount of limbal involvement in clock hours of affected limbus/ percentage of conjunctival involvement. The conjunctival involvement should be calculated only for the bulbar conjunctiva, up to and including the conjunctival fornices.\r\n\r\nGrade I: In Grade I, there is 0 clock hours of limbal involvement, 0% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 0/0%, and the prognosis is very good.\r\nGrade II: In Grade II, there is less than 3 clock hours of limbal involvement, less than 30% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 0.1- 3/ 1- 29.9%, and the prognosis is good.\r\nGrade III: In Grade III, there is between 3- 6 clock hours of limbal involvement, 30- 50% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 3.1- 6/ 31- 50%, and the prognosis is good.\r\nGrade IV: In Grade IV, there is between 6- 9 clock hours of limbal involvement, 50- 75% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 6.1- 9/ 51- 75%, and the prognosis is good to guarded.\r\nGrade V: In Grade V, there is between 9- 12 clock hours of limbal involvement, 75- 100% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 9.1- 11.9/ 75- 100%, and the prognosis is guarded to poor.\r\nGrade VI: In Grade VI, there is total limbal (12 clock hours) involvement, total conjunctival (100%) involvement, analogue scale reading of 12/ 100%, and the prognosis is very poor.\r\n\r\nMcCulley (1987) has divided the clinical course of chemical injury in four distinct phases:\r\n\r\nImmediate.\r\nAcute phase (0- 7 days).\r\nEarly reparative phase (7- 21 days).\r\nLate reparative phase (after 21 days).\r\n\r\nThe clinical findings immediately following chemical exposure may be used to assess the severity and prognosis of the injury.\r\nHughes (1946) classification (modified by Ballen in 1963, Roper- Hall in 1965 and Pfister et al in 1982) provides a prognostic guideline based on corneal appearance and extent of limbal ischaemia. The Roper-hall classification system was introduced in the mid-1960s and is the most established and commonly applied system.\r\n\r\nGrade I injury: In Grade I injury, there is corneal epithelial damage, no corneal opacity, no limbal ischaemia, and the prognosis is good.\r\nGrade II injury: In Grade II injury, the cornea is hazy but the iris details are visible. There is also ishaemia involving less than one third of the limbus and the prognosis is good.\r\nGrade III injury: In Grade III injury, there is total epithelial loss, stromal haze with obscuration of iris details, ischaemia of one third to one half of the limbus, and the prognosis is guarded.\r\nGrade IV injury: In Grade IV injury, the cornea is opaque with no view of the iris or pupil, the ischaemia is greater than one half of the limbus, and the prognosis is poor.\r\n\r\nIn the acute phase (during first week), Grade I injuries heal while Grade II injuries slowly recover with corneal clarity. Grade III and Grade IV injuries have little or no epithelialisation, with no collagenolysis or vascularisation. Intraocular pressure may be elevated due to inflammation or decreased due to damage to ciliary body.\r\nDuring early reparative phase (7- 21 days), in Grade II injuries, re- epithelialisation is completed with clearing of opacification. In more severe cases, there may not be a change in clinical appearance and there may be delayed or arrested re- epithelialisation. Keratocyte proliferation occurs with production of collagen and collagenase, resulting in progressive thinning with potential of perforation.\r\nIn late reparative phase, re- epithelialisation patterns divide injured eyes into two groups:\r\n\r\nFirst group: In the first group, epithelialisation is complete or is nearly complete with sparing of limbal stem cells. Corneal anaesthesia, goblet cell/ mucinous abnormalities, and irregular epithelial basement membrane regeneration may persist.\r\nSecond group: In the second group, limbal stem cell damage results in corneal re- epithelialisation from conjunctival epithelium. This group has the worst prognosis with severe ocular surface damage characterised by vascularisation and scarring, goblet cell/ mucinous deficiency, and recurrent and persistent erosions. There may be cicatricial entropion (inward turning of eyelid), trichiasis (misdirected eyelashes), and symblepharon (adhesion between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) formation. A fibro-vascular pannus may form if there is no ulceration, and it compromises visual rehabilitation.\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis:\r\n\r\nThermal burns to the eyes.\r\nUltraviolet radiation keratitis.\r\nOther causes of corneal opacification.\r\nOcular cicatricial pemphigoid."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nPreparation for vision restoration: Preparation for vision restoration must begin immediately after the injury. Deliberate and timely treatment determines successful outcomes in the rehabilitative process.\r\nIn succession, management consists of emergency treatment, pressure control, suppression of inflammation, enhancing stromal repair, and establishing eyelid-globe congruity during the early days, weeks, and months after the injury.\r\nTopical or oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and topical beta blockers continue to form the mainstay of intraocular pressure control. Fibroblast inhibiting mitomycin C may improve the success of filtration surgery for glaucoma. Drainage procedures may be done if one or more filtration surgeries fail.\r\nOperative procedures include amniotic membrane transplant, corneal epithelial stem cell transplants, keratoplasty, large-diameter lamellar keratoplasty, and keratoprosthesis.\r\nMedical therapy:\r\nEmergency management:\r\n\r\nIrrigation of eyes: Emergency management requires prompt irrigation and the removal of residual chemical debris from the eye. The objectives are to minimise penetration of the chemical into the anterior chamber, and to remove a potential reservoir for ongoing injury. Immediate copious irrigation should begin at the scene of the incident and this is an important intervention. Irrigation with the lids kept open should be initiated and maintained at least for 30 minutes, which may require 1- 2 liters of solution. Irrigation should be continued until pH neutralisation is achieved. Patients with immediate copious irrigation have less severe injury, as compared to eyes which are not irrigated. Although there may be an advantage in the use of amphoteric buffering solution, any available neutral irrigation solution may be used in emergency. Solutions available for irrigation include normal saline, normal saline with bicarbonate, Ringer\u2019s lactate, balanced salt solution (BSS), and BSS- plus. No therapeutic differences have been noted among these solutions. After copious irrigation, necrotic corneal epithelium should be d\u00e9brided to promote re-epithelialisation.\r\nWhere possible, topical anaesthetic drops should be instilled to reduce pain and blepharospasm, thereby facilitating irrigation. Remove all particulate matter, and this may require eyelid eversion (double eversion may be necessary) and cleaning of the fornices. Lime particles should be removed with forceps and a cotton-tipped applicator soaked in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) may help with the removal of stubborn particles. Few patients may require general anaesthetic or sedation to effectively remove particulate matter.\r\nAqueous humour replacement: External irrigation is of limited value in eliminating chemicals once they have reached the anterior chamber. Role of paracentesis (removal of aqueous from anterior chamber) and irrigation of the anterior chamber is controversial. Nonetheless, it may be reasonable to consider aqueous humour replacement in patients with severe injuries presenting within first two hours following exposure.\r\n\r\nAcute and Reparative phases:\r\nAfter irrigation, better outcomes may be expected with prompt re-epithelialisation, while delayed or absent re-epithelialisation may require surgical intervention.\r\n\r\nCorticosteroid therapy: Intensive corticosteroid therapy during first two weeks decreases the inflammatory response (which can delay epithelial migration), and thus enhances re-epithelialisation. Corticosteroids use during first 10 days of injury has no adverse effect on outcome. Prolonged use of corticosteroids beyond two weeks may lead to stromal ulceration, since steroids blunt stromal wound repair by decreasing keratocyte migration and collagen synthesis.\r\nMedroxyprogesterone: Medroxyprogesterone is a pogestational steroid that has weak anti- inflammatory activity as compared to corticosteroids. Medroxyprogesterone inhibits collagenase but, unlike corticosteroids, minimally suppresses stromal wound repair. Medroxyprogesterone may be substituted for corticosteroid after two weeks if worsening corneal ulceration is of concern.\r\nTopical and systemic sodium ascorbate (10%): Topical and systemic sodium ascorbate (10%) replenish depleted levels from the aqueous humour, following injury with alkali. Ascorbate is a cofactor in the rate- limiting step of collagen synthesis, and thus decreases the incidence of stromal ulceration. The molecular events responsible for the failure of collagen to assemble properly occur because of the deficiency of the reducing agent ascorbate.\r\nTopical Citrate (10%): Topical buffered citrate is a calcium chelator that decreases intracellular levels of calcium in neutrophils and thus impairs chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and release of lysosomal enzymes. Topical citrate also reduces corneal ulceration and perforation of eye.\r\nOral tetracyclines: Oral tetracyclines offer protection against collagenolytic degradation.\r\n\r\nTopical antibiotics may be required to prevent superadded infections. Cycloplegics provide comfort to the eye. Artificial tears, preferably preservative free, may provide general lubrication for ocular comfort.\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\nSurgical intervention that may help stabilising the ocular surface in severe chemical injury includes:\r\n\r\nTenonplasty: Tenonplasty attempts to re-establish limbal vascularity in severe injuries and to promote re- epithelialisation. In this, all necrotic conjunctival and episcleral tissues are excised. Tenon\u2019s capsule is dissected with blunt instrument, and the resultant flap with its preserved blood supply is advanced to the limbus.\r\nTissue adhesives (tissue glue): Tissue adhesives preserve integrity in the event of corneal thinning with impending or actual perforation of the globe. This is usually accompanied by the application of a soft bandage contact lens, which prevents glue dislodgement. Tissue glue can stop further melting by excluding inflammatory cells and their mediators. Tissue adhesives also provide a means of delaying penetrating keratoplasty.\r\nAmniotic membrane transplantation: Amniotic membrane transplantation may be used as supplement to surgical procedures where coverage of raw surfaces or suppression of inflammation is required. Amniotic membrane has anti-angiogenic (inhibitors of blood vessels growth) and anti-inflammatory proteins capable of suppressing the inflammatory response. Amniotic membrane can create a new basement membrane and promote epithelial healing. Amniotic membrane might be applied very early after a chemical injury following emergency services, usually weeks later. Despite benefits, amniotic membrane cannot replace the need for corneal stem cells.\r\nCorneal stem cell transplantation: Replacement of the corneal stem cells lost due to injury is important in the restoration of an intact and normal corneal epithelial cell layer. These primitive, slow-cycling stem cells are located in the limbal area. \r\n\r\nMonocular injuries allow for procurement of stem cells from the uninjured eye. When the injury is bilateral, Pfister (1993) showed that allografted limbal tissue was capable of restoring the stem cell population from an unrelated donor. Allografted corneal stem cells must be protected from the recipient immune process by systemic immune-suppression e.g. cyclosporine.\r\n\r\nCorneal transplantation (Keratoplasty):\r\n\r\n Success in restorative corneal surgery is governed by:\r\n- Lid-globe congruity with normal blinking and the absence of corneal exposure. Preparatory procedures to lyse symblepharon, expand cul-de-sacs, and to eliminate lagophthalmos are often required to re-establish normal lid functioning.\r\n- Quality and quantity of tear film.\r\n- The presence of epithelial stem cells phenotypic for cornea.\r\n- The absence of any current ulceration, inflammation, and/or uncontrolled glaucoma. Secondary glaucoma must also be controlled with medications or filtration surgery.\r\n- Flawless surgical technique.\r\n- Fresh corneal transplant tissue.\r\nThe value of preoperative use of LASER for blood vessels at the limbus in high-risk patients is controversial, but at least it reduces bleeding at the time of surgery.\r\nIf corneal surgery is delayed 18 months to 2 years after a chemical burn, it increases the chances of success, especially without pre-existing ulceration, perforation, or glaucoma.\r\nPenetrating keratoplasty: Penetrating keratoplasty refers to the full- thickness replacement of the affected cornea with a healthy donor. Penetrating keratoplasty may be used to provide tectonic support (such as in corneal thinning and perforation), and to improve visual outcome (such as in the replacement of corneal scarring).\r\nLarge-diameter penetrating keratoplasty: Replacement of the entire cornea and adjacent stem cells by large-diameter penetrating keratoplasty may be performed. One potential danger might be that such large transplants might interfere with the trabecular outflow channels and hence increase the likelihood of glaucoma. Proximity to the limbal blood vessels makes an immune rejection more likely.\r\nLarge-diameter lamellar keratoplasty: A very promising technique in corneal transplantation for chemical injuries includes the use of 12 or 13 mm lamellar corneal transplants, along with the limbal epithelial stem cell population. Smaller lamellar transplants are useful to fill in deep corneal ulcerations, descemetoceles, or frank corneal perforations.\r\n\r\nKeratoprosthesis (Artificial cornea): In the most severe cases, implantation of a keratoprosthesis might afford the only means by which vision can be restored.\r\n\r\nIndications for keratoprosthesis are:\r\n- Corneas exhibiting exuberant vascularity.\r\n- Repeated failures of fresh transplanted corneal tissue.\r\n- Chronic limbal stem cell deficiency.\r\n- Inability to restore normal lid anatomy.\r\nThe operation is usually advised in patients with severe bilateral injuries where serviceable vision is not present in either eye. A surprising degree of success may be achieved with keratoprosthesis. Critical to the visual outcome of a keratoprosthesis is the control of intraocular pressure at all times after the chemical injury.\r\n\r\nConjunctival transplantation: Conjunctival transplantation is a means of restoring conjunctival fornices following fibrosis. This provides compatible tissue with a basement membrane, unlike other mucosal replacements. The procedure involves taking a sample of upper bulbar conjunctiva from the contralateral (other uninvolved) eye.\r\nBuccal and Nasal mucosa transplant: Buccal mucosa grafts may be used to treat symblepharon (adhesion between bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva), trichiasis (misdirected eyelashes), distichiasis (partial or complete second row of eyelashes), or entropion. The graft is usually obtained from the posterior aspect of the upper or lower lip. The advantage of nasal mucosal grafts lies in the ability to obtain large sized grafts.\r\n\r\n\r\nStages of ocular recovery following chemical injury (Colby, 2010):\r\n\r\nInitial phase (day 0): Clinical findings relate to the severity of injury and can be graded according to degree of limbal, corneal and conjunctival involvement.\r\nAcute phase (day 0- 7): Epithelial re-growth begins to occur if there is sufficient amount of undamaged limbal stem cells. Treatment should be directed at encouraging growth while suppressing inflammation.\r\nPhase of early repair (days 7- 21): Corneal/ conjunctival epithelium and keratocytes proliferate during this stage. Mild injuries show complete re-epithelialisation while more severe injuries can have persistent epithelial defects. Activity of collagenases peaks by day 14- 21 while collagen synthesis continues. Treatment should attempt to maximise collagen synthesis while minimising collagenase activity.\r\nPhase of late repair (after day 21): In mild injuries, where the limbal stem cell population is intact, repair is completed. In injuries, where there is focal stem cell loss, there may be a focal growth of conjunctiva on the cornea. In more severe injuries, there is delayed re-epithelialisation of the cornea, ultimately leading to either repopulation by conjunctival epithelium or stromal ulceration and permanent scarring. In cases of severe limbal damage, despite optimal management, the eye cannot be salvaged.\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement of exposure to lacrimatory agents:\r\n\r\nTear gas and Chemical Mace: Following exposure to tear gas and Chemical Mace, thorough rinsing/ irrigation provides immense relief.\r\nPepper spray (Oleoresin capsicum): Irrigation with fresh water, although recommended, has little effect as capsicin is not soluble in water. Flushing the eye with a solution containing half liquid antacid (of aluminium or magnesium hydroxide base) and half water (LAW) is more effective.\r\nMustard gas (Dichlorodiethyl sulphide): Prompt irrigation of eyes with running water or normal saline is useful. Topical antibiotic, cycloplegic and lubricant may be used for associated corneal erosions.\r\n\r\nExposure to chemicals used for festivals in India also requires thorough rinsing/ irrigation with running water or normal saline for relief.\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nThe prognosis for severe injury is typically poor and may result in widespread damage to the ocular surface epithelium, cornea and anterior segment. However, in recent years, the prognosis of severe ocular burns has improved, with advances in the understanding of the physiology of the cornea and the resultant development of enhanced medical and surgical treatments. The final visual prognosis is influenced by:\r\n\r\nThe nature of the chemical insult.\r\nThe extent of ocular damage.\r\nThe timing and efficacy of treatment."

                "A cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China on 31 December 2019. On 7 January, Chinese authority identified a new type of coronavirus as a cause of pneumonia outbreak, which is different from any other human coronaviruses discovered so far. The new strain is named as 2019-nCoV. Afterwards on 11February 2020, this virus is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and disease is named as COVID-19 by World Health Organisation (WHO).\r\nTo date, other six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified. Out of these, four are globally circulated in the human population and contribute to approximately one-third of common cold infections in humans. The other two viruses are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS Coronavirus) causing severe respiratory diseases. Coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, are zoonotic, and can be transmitted from animals (civet cats and dromedary camels, respectively) to humans.\r\n(SARS-CoV was first reported in 2002-2003 in Guangdong, China and MERS coronavirus was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012).\r\nThe precise zoonotic (animal) origin of the 2019\u2011nCoV is still uncertain. The virus has been identified in environmental samples from a live animal market in Wuhan, China and some human cases have been epidemiologically linked to this market.\r\nEpidemiological evidence shows that 2019\u2011nCoV can be transmitted from one individual to another.

                "Computer vision syndrome (CVS), also referred to as digital eye strain,describes eye and vision-related problems that result from prolonged computer, tablet, e-reader and cell phone use. Many individuals experience eye discomfort and vision problems when viewing digital screens. The level of discomfort appears to increase with the amount of digital screen use.\r\nThe main visual symptoms reported by visual display terminal (VDT) users include eyestrain, tired eyes, irritation, burning sensation, redness, blurred vision, and double vision, thus termed the phrase \u2018computer vision syndrome\u2019 (CVS). Vision problems and symptoms associated with the use of the eyes are the most frequently occurring health problems among VDT users. CVS not only causes pain and discomfort to the individual, but also reduces overall efficiency by reducing the time that a person can effectively work.\r\nMajority of VDT patients had symptoms that were different than other near-point workers, especially as related to glare, lighting, and spectacle requirements. Greater frequency and severity of symptoms were also noted. One study shows higher degree of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) in symptomatic computer users than in computer users who have lesser degrees of ocular surface complaints.\r\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration of the US Government (OSHA) has defined CVS as a \u2018complex of eye and vision problems that are experienced during and related to computer use; it is repetitive strain disorder that appears to be growing rapidly, with some studies estimating that 90% US workers using computers from more than three hours per day experience CVS in some form\u2019 (Nilsen, 2005). Anshel (2006) have defined CVS as the \u2018complex of eye and vision problems related to near work, which are experienced during or related to computer use\u2019. Chakrabarti (2007) defined CVS as the \u2018excessive viewing of visual display terminal (VDT) screens without proper attention to practical visual hygiene\u2019. The American Optometric Association (AOA) has defined CVS as \u2018a complex of eye and vision problems related to activities, which stress the near vision and which are experienced in relation or during the use of computers\u2019. It has now been concluded that CVS is characterised by visual symptoms which result from interaction with a computer display or its environment. In most cases the symptoms occur because the visual demands of the task exceed the visual abilities of the individual for comfortable performance of task.\r\nOffice work involves a range of activities including typing, reading, and writing. Each activity was adequately varied in the requirements of posture and vision. Computers have combined these tasks to where most can be performed without moving from the desktop, thereby improving quality, production, and efficiency. The popularity and affordability of personal computers with the internet capabilities at home introduced more computer users.\r\nStudies have not clearly indicated a negative effect on computer user due to radiation levels from VDTs. VDTs are known to emit many types of radiation, including soft X-radiation, optical radiation, radiofrequency radiation, very low frequency radiation, and extremely low frequency radiation. Most women in offices, who work with VDTs, do not increase their risk of miscarriage.\r\nIt may well be that high computer usage raises the number of dry eye sufferers and/or increases the severity of symptoms, but studies have not produced any direct comparison of groups that would allow us to conclude that computer use bears a long- term causal relation to ocular surface disease. There needs to be more prospective studies to elucidate direct relationship between ocular surface disease (e.g. MGD) and CVS."

                "Risk factors for CVS include:\r\nI. Factors influencing surface disease: \r\nThere are several factors that contribute to CVS and dry eye syndrome (DES). They include the following:\r\n\r\nEnvironmental factors: The cornea is very sensitive to drying and chemical imbalances from environmental factors such as dry air, ventilation fans, electrostatic build up, airborne paper dust, laser and photocopy toner, and building contaminants.\r\nReduced blink rate: Most individuals blink normally 10- 15 times/ minute. Studies have shown that the blink rate at the computer is significantly less. A reduced blink rate at the VDT contributes to a poor-quality tear film and temporary as well as long-term stress upon the cornea and ocular surface. This results in symptoms of DES.\r\nDuration of computer use: Longer duration of the computer work tends to result in long-lasting complaints that persist, even when the work is completed.\r\nHeight and inclination of monitor: Increased odds ratio (eye strain) for certain eye symptoms is observed when the computer monitor is kept at about the eye level instead of below the eye level. The VDT should be at least 5 to 6 inches below the straight line of the viewer\u2019s vision. Such measures reduce not only dry eye, but also the severity of the spasm of neck muscles. OSHA has recommended that the center of computer monitor should normally be located 15 to 20 cm below the horizontal eye level and that the entire visual area of the display screen should be located such that the downward viewing angle is greater than 60 degrees.\r\nTaking frequent breaks: Taking frequent breaks from computer use is shown to increase the efficiency because the breaks relax eye accommodative system, thus decreasing eye fatigue and headache.\r\nDistance of VDT from the eyes: Distance of VDT from the eyes is an important risk factor for CVS. Closer the VDT to the eyes, it is more difficult for the eyes to accommodate. Excess accommodation results in overwork on ciliary muscles which manifest as eye fatigue and headache.\r\nIncreased exposure due to position of monitor: Normally reading of text on paper is done while looking downwards and it results in the eyelid covering a good deal of the front surface of the eye. This covering minimises the evaporation of tears. On the other hand, computer users look at their reading material in straight ahead gaze. This result in a wider opening between the eyelids, and an increased surface area exposed to the effects of evaporation.\r\nGender: The prevalence of DES is twice as frequent in females as compared to males.\r\nAge: Tear production normally decreases with age. Although DES can occur at any age in both men and women.\r\nMenopause: Hormonal changes have been identified as contributing to DES. Postmenopausal women represent the group of individuals affected most by DES. Sometimes it is difficult to assess the relative contributions of menopause and ageing.\r\nSystemic diseases and disease syndromes: DES is associated with various systemic diseases. In the case of Sj\u04e7gren\u2019s syndrome, dry mouth and rheumatoid arthritis can assist in making the diagnosis. Several autoimmune diseases also have association with DES.\r\nSystemic medications: There are several systemic medications which contribute to ocular drying. Most prominent among them are diuretics, antihistamines, and anti-hypertensives.\r\nSpectacle wear: CVS with eye redness has significant association with the use of spectacles.\r\nContact lens wear: Contact lens comfort is highly dependent on the fit of the lens and lubrication of the eye. If the eye is dry, the lenses dry easily and adhere to the upper eyelid during the blink. This \u2018friction effect\u2019 from DES produces discomfort.\r\nCosmetics: Cosmetics may block the openings of the oil-secreting meibomian glands and create debris and inflammation. This leads to rapid evaporation of the water component of the tear film and deposition of foreign bodies from cosmetics in the tear film or on the ocular surface with resultant discomfort.\r\nCholesterol: There may be statistically significant decreased prevalence of low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in patients with moderate to severe MGD. The cause of this is unknown, but the findings suggest that elevated HDL may be a risk factor for the development of MGD, despite being known as \u2018good cholesterol\u2019 with its cardio-protective effects.\r\n\r\nII. Visual effects of display features: \r\n\r\nDisplay quality: Visual performance is affected by a number of display parameters, such as character size, structure, and style; and by image contrast and stability.\r\n\r\nThe images produced on a VDT consists of thousands of tiny, bright spots (pixels) or horizontal lines (rasters), which collectively form unresolved images that blur together and lack sharp edges. The more the dots or lines displayed on a monitor to produce a picture, the sharper and clearer the image will appear. With time, the resolution of monitors has improved drastically, producing displays approaching that of typeset documents.\r\nMany factors affect readability and legibility of characters on the screen. Words containing upper case in combination with lower case are more easily interpreted than all upper case documents. The spacing between characters and lines also affects picture quality. High levels of contrast and brightness are known to represent the most common causes of character blur. Screens should contain dark characters against a light background display screen, rather than the opposite. Switches from a light background hard copy to dark background display causes fatigue of the iris muscle.\r\n\r\nLighting and glare: Improper lighting conditions of a workstation can also adversely affect ocular comfort. Constant and bright illumination from surrounding sources of light creates reflection and glare. These problems do not produce chronic visual disorders but are sources of annoyance and possibly visual fatigue.\r\n\r\nIn cases where it is not practical to reduce surrounding light, reduction of reflections and increase in contrast may be obtained from antiglare filters.\r\nRecent studies demonstrate differing results in the efficacy of symptoms relief with screen filters. One recent study revealed that people who used a screen filter reported less occurrence, shorter duration, and less intensive eye and musculoskeletal complaints after one month of use. It was concluded that screen filters could improve the conditions for visual perception and thus relieve eyestrain. Another study showed that filters by themselves do not reduce the occurrence of asthenopia (rapid fatigue of the eyes). More research is needed to determine whether screen filters are effective in the relief of ocular symptoms.\r\n\r\nRefresh rates: The refresh rate of a VDT represents the number of times per minute (measured in Hertz) the screen is repainted to produce an image. If the refresh rate is too slow, the characters on the screen may appear to flicker. Perceived flicker has resulted in subjective complaints of annoyance, fatigue, and headache. The critical fusion frequency is the refresh rate at which humans can no longer distinguish the pulsating beams of light as separate entities. In most viewing situations, this rate is 30- 50 Hertz.\r\n\r\nStudies have shown that much higher refresh rates may decrease ocular symptoms and increase user functionality.\r\n\r\nRadiation: The potential of health risk concerns that radiation emissions from VDTs could be responsible for hazardous effects to the computer user. However, VDTs neither produce nor emit alpha, beta, gamma, or hard X-radiation. Small amount of soft X-rays is produced, but almost all of the radiation is contained by the glass screen of the monitor.\r\n\r\nNumerous studies have shown that there is no evidence to support that VDT operators face health hazards or have exposure to electric, magnetic, or ionizing radiation fields significantly above ambient levels.\r\n\r\nPathophysiology:\r\nEye focusing mechanism in human beings responds well to images with well defined edges with good background and contrast between the background and letters. Visual work on computer involves continuous muscular activity and it includes frequent saccadic eye movements (ocular motility), accommodation (focusing) and vergence (alignment demands).\r\nCharacters on computer screen are made up of tiny dots called pixels. Each pixel is bright at its center and decreases in brightness towards the outer edges. This causes electronic characters to have blurred edges as compared to letters on a paper with sharply defined edges. This makes very difficult for eye to maintain focus on pixels, and the eye relaxes to focus behind the screen. This is called the resting point of accommodation (RPA) or dark focus. Thus, eye constantly relaxes to RPA and strains to refocus on to the screen thereby leading to eyestrain."

                "Diagnosis depends upon the symptoms being faced by the patients and the clinical features.\r\nA complete ocular surface examination is imperative to rule out local and systemic features associated with DES, blepharitis, inflammation, and lid margin disease. Patients with significant aqueous deficiency with basal or Schirmer test 1 value less than 5 mm should be evaluated.\r\nCVS and meibomian gland disease (MGD):\r\nThe rate at which people blink decreases by more than 60% when they stare at a computer screen, suggesting that the acute decrease in blinks can acutely increase symptoms of Dry eye syndrome (DES) or keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS).Computer users often complain that their eyes feel dry, burning, gritty, or heavy after an extended period at VDT. Their eyes may even reflexively tear in an attempt to properly lubricate and rewet the front surface of the eye. DES may be a primary cause of ocular fatigue, such as experienced when using a VDT, where the blink rate is decreased and the exposed ocular surface area is increased. Blink rate is decreased further in dark where it is difficult to read.\r\nThe tear film, which overlies and protects the cornea, consists of, from anterior surface inward, a lipid layer, an aqueous gel layer, and a mucin layer. DES results from evaporation of the aqueous component. The lipid surface layer protects the aqueous layer from evaporation. It is secreted as meibum by the meibomian glands embedded in the eyelids. The normal physiological mechanism of meibum secretion is associated with blink reflex. The normal blink expresses meibum from the glands and spreads it evenly on top of the aqueous layer. Several studies have shown that computer use produces considerable reduction of the spontaneous blink rate. Hence, computer use reduces meibum secretion and exposes tear film to increased aqueous evaporation. Because the tear film is maintained by a balance of secretion of the lipid meibum layer and the aqueous layer, reduction of secretion of either results in a tear film imbalance that can lead to symptoms and signs of DES.\r\nAn immediate reduction in blink rate acutely alters the ocular surface because it causes poor tear spreading and dessication. Longer term reduction of blinking may alter meibomian gland. Eventually, MGD may worsen, causing further reduction of the outflow of meibum, alteration in the normal bacterial flora, increase in inflammation, and obstruction of the glands. Thus, reduced blink rate at the computer contributes to poor tear film quality and increased evaporation, which reduces the overall efficiency and comfort of work. Furthermore, the positive correlation between lifetime computer usage and ocular surface disease index (OSDI) score shows that people who use the computer tend to have more significant ocular surface symptoms.\r\nCVS and asthenopia:\r\nMany individuals have marginal vision disorders, such as difficulties with accommodation, or binocular vision problems that do not cause symptoms when performing less demanding visual tasks.\r\nUse of VDT creates asthenopia or a feeling of ocular discomfort or tiredness. In fact, symptomatic visual complaints were reported by 75% of VDT operators working 6-9 hours in front of their screens compared to 50% of the other workers (Mutti et al. 1996).\r\nAfter working with the monitor, the most important changes are:\r\n\r\nDiminished power of accommodation.\r\nRemoval of the near point of convergence.\r\nDeviation or phoria for near vision.\r\n\r\nThese results suggest that the weakness of important visual functions could be the cause of eyestrain in computer operators. Prolonged work at a VDT has been reported to result in changes in both relative accommodation and vergence.\r\nOne study noted a high prevalence of exophoria, convergence insufficiency, and low fusional convergence among VDT workers. They also found that the accommodative amplitude decreased significantly more for VDT users than for non-users.\r\nVDTs are a major source of near work for many adults, but do not appear to result in losses of accommodative and vergence functions beyond the ordinary effects of age.\r\nCVS and transient myopia:\r\nAccommodative effort during near work is thought to be a causative factor in the development of myopia. It is clear that near work with VDTs result in a small, temporary myopic shift. In a cross-sectional comparison of VDT users and typists, VDT users experienced a myopic shift of about -0.12 Diopters after the work period, while the refractive error of typists was unchanged."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nThe treatment of CVS requires a multidirectional approach due to the variety of complaints by the users. When treating a patient, it is important to consider ocular therapy as well as adjustment of workstation and habits of users.\r\nLocal ocular surface disorders should be treated aggressively and on a long term basis. Eye care providers and patients need to understand the chronicity of this disorder in order to maintain compliance to treatment.\r\nTreatment includes: \r\nRestoring aqueous deficiencies with \r\n- Lubrication.\r\n- Partial or complete punctal occlusion.\r\nShort- and long- term inflammation control with \r\n- Topical steroids.\r\n- Omega 3.\r\n- Topical cyclosporine A.\r\nIsolation technique, that is, microenvironment glasses (MEGS) or specialised contact lenses, are helpful if the patients are moderately to severely symptomatic or have significant findings of dry eye or lid margin disease on clinical examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nVDT positioning: Computer users often assume uncomfortable positions in order to properly view the screen which leads to pain. It is thus important to keep monitor at proper distance and height.\r\n\r\nPreviously, it was recommended that the eye should be 16- 30 inches from the screen. Recent data suggest that further distances may be more favourable to ocular symptoms. These studies suggest that distances of 35- 40 inches may produce fewer complaints of visual strain.\r\nIt is recommended that the screen should be placed 10-20\u02da below (or the middle of the screen 5- 6 inches below) the eye level. When the screen is higher than this level, VDT users often tilt back their heads, causing muscle strain in the neck. Lowering the monitor allows the VDT user to gaze downward, thus exposing less ocular surface to ambient air and reducing tear film loss.\r\n\r\nLighting: Proper lighting within the computer workstation area improve visual comfort and performance while eliminating annoyance and visual fatigue. An ideal environment would allow equalised brightness throughout the visual field. Intense fluorescent lights can be diminished by removing a few of them. Excessive window lighting should be filtered with blinds, window coverings, or window tinting.\r\n\r\nThe actual type of lighting also appears to be important. One study focused on the visual work capacity with different sources of illumination. It was found that sodium lamps were the most adequate for high functional capacity of the visual analyser.\r\nIt is important to position the light carefully so that it does not throw bright light into the eyes.\r\nAntiglare filters may not reduce symptoms of asthenopia, but have been shown to reduce glare and improve contrast from the screen. This provides an effective means to eliminate reflections and therefore improve visual comfort.\r\n\r\nWork breaks: It is shown that when regular breaks are implemented, work efficiency improves, which compensates for the time lost during the break. Short frequent breaks decrease in worker discomfort and increase in productivity compared to the historical 15-minute morning and afternoon breaks. A quick walk around the office provides stretching of strained and fatigued muscles and gives relaxation.\r\n\r\nLong periods of work without breaks are thought to be detrimental to ocular symptoms. Frequent breaks are recommended to restore and relax the accommodative system, thereby preventing eyestrain. It is believed that looking away at a distant object at least twice in an hour during computer usage is sufficient for prevention of visual fatigue.\r\n\r\nLubricating eye drops: Lubricating eye drops relieve the symptoms of dry eyes due to decreased blink rates. A tear substitute can periodically rewet the ocular surface, contribute to tear volume, and maintain the proper balance of salts and acidity while viewing a terminal. One study shows that higher viscosity eye drops may be more beneficial than balanced salt solutions. They normalised the inter-blink interval and relieved ocular discomfort more efficiently than balanced salt solutions following VDT use.\r\nCyclosporine A drops: While artificial tears are effective, cyclosporine A drops may be needed long term to effectively treat chronic ocular surface inflammation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOmega 3 and topical steroids have also been used for control of inflammation.\r\n\r\nComputer eye glasses: Studies show that it is effective to reduce evaporation rate by providing a physical barrier to air currents, evaporation, and an increased relative humidity via an enclosed environment with glasses. Isolation techniques with swim or workshop goggles or modified spectacles surrounding the eye decrease entry of particulate matter and prevent desiccation.\r\n\r\nOccasional computer viewers may be able to get away with using their general eyewear, but those who spend several hours a day, may benefit from the use of micro-environment glasses (MEGS). MEGS, unlike swim goggles, can be optically modified and still create an increase in humidified microenvironment that successfully reduces dry eye symptoms and signs as well as symptoms in symptomatic computer users.\r\nPresbyopes need the right format of eyewear. Conventional bifocals are designed for viewing at 16 inches at an angle of 20\u02da below primary gaze. Computer screens are usually 24 inches away and only slightly below primary gaze. Occupational progressive lenses are now available, which incorporate a large area in the top half of the lens for mid-distance viewing (i.e. VDT) and a bottom half of the lens for near distance (i.e. keyboard and desktop). Some lenses even contain a small area for distance viewing, usually at the top of the lens.\r\n\r\nPartial or complete punctal occlusion: Partial or complete punctal occlusion may be resorted to restore aqueous deficiencies."

                "Child maltreatment is abuse to children under 18 years of age by a parent, caregiver, or another person in a custodial role (e.g., clergy, coach, teacher). World Health Organization (WHO) defines child maltreatment as all types of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, negligence and commercial or other exploitation, which results in actual or potential harm to the child\u2019s health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust or power. Child maltreatment can be distinguished in to:\r\nPhysical abuse, that is intentional use of physical force against a child such as inflicting physical injury by hitting, beating, shaking, biting, scalding, burning, kicking, poisoning and suffocating.\r\nSexual abuse involves engaging a child in sexual acts. It includes fondling, rape, and exposing a child to other sexual activities.\r\nEmotional and psychological abuse refers to behaviors that harm a child\u2019s self-worth or emotional well-being such as name calling, shaming, rejection, withholding love, and threatening.\r\nNeglect is the failure to meet a child\u2019s basic needs. These needs include housing, food, clothing, education, and access to medical care.\r\nChild maltreatment is a global problem with serious life-long consequences. International studies reveal that 20% of women and 5\u201310% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25\u201350% of all children report being physically abused. Additionally, many children are subject to emotional abuse (sometimes referred to as psychological abuse) and to neglect. Every year, there are an estimated 41000 homicide deaths in children below 15 years of age (WHO).\r\nIn Asia due to high population density, poverty, illiteracy, caste system and landlessness, lack of economic opportunities, rural-urban migration, population growth, political instability and weak implementation of legal provisions the issues of child labour and child sexual exploitation are high.\r\nAccording to the 2011 Census, some 470 million people in the country are aged below eighteen years and constitute 41 percent of India's total population. Problem of child abuse is prevalent in India as in many other countries and there was a need to understand its dimensions and complexities. Study on child abuse: India 2005*, was conducted by Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India. In the study group physical abuse was found in 69% of child respondents, sexual abuse in 53% children and emotional abuse in 48% children.\r\n(*child abuse: physical abuse, sexual abuse and emotional abuse and girl child neglect in five different evidence groups-children in a family environment, children in school, children at work, children on the street and children in institutions).\r\nNow that the scale and impact of all forms of violence against children is becoming better known, children must be provided with the effective prevention and protection to which they have an unqualified right."

The retina usually recovers spontaneously without leading to permanent loss of vision.\r\nRetinal contusion: Retinal contusion is produced due to more severe trauma to the eye.

Tooth Decay (Dental caries) happens when bacteria in mouth make acid that attacks the enamel. It can lead to cavities, which are holes in the teeth. If it is not treated well in time, it can cause pain, infection, and even tooth loss.\r\nIn most developing low-income countries, the prevalence rate of dental caries is high and more than 90% of caries is untreated. An estimated 5 billion people worldwide suffer from dental caries.\r\nHOW DO CAVITIES OCCUR?\r\nTooth surfaces are rough, uneven and a favourite place for cavity-causing bacteria to hide andwhere leftover food also gets accumulated. These bacteria combine with food and constantly form a soft, sticky film called plaque. When we eat or drink foods containing sugars, the bacteria in plaque produce acid that attacks the tooth enamel. Due to stickiness of the plaque this acid remains in contact with our teeth and over time damages tooth enamel and causes cavities.\r\nThe development of caries requires sugars and bacteria to be present. It is influenced by the susceptibility of the tooth, the bacterial profile, quantity and quality of the saliva, low levels of fluoride, and the time for which dietary carbohydrates are available in the oral cavity for bacterial fermentation (i.e. the frequency of sugar intake).\r\nSalvia and fluorides, helps the enamel to repair itself by replacing the minerals. Teeth go through this natural process of losing minerals and regaining minerals all day long. But if we don't take care of our teeth and/or eat and drink lot of sugary things, enamel will keep losing minerals leading to tooth decay."

Birth defects are health conditions that are present at birth and they change the shape or function of one or more body parts. During the development of lip and palate in early pregnancy period, incomplete fusion of upper lip and palate leads to the formation of cleft lip and palate in a child.\r\nA child can have a cleft lip, a cleft palate or both because development of lips and palate occur at different times during gestation. Children with these birth defects have difficulty in feeding and talking. They are also prone to ear infections, hearing loss, and dental problems.\r\nCleft lip and cleft palate are common birth defects and happen very early in the pregnancy. Asian population have highest frequency, often 1 in 500 or higher. Cleft lip with or without cleft palate is more common in males than in females. Isolated cleft palate is more common in females whereas males have more severe defects.\r\nCleft lip is an opening in the upper lip due to incomplete formation of the upper lip before birth. It may be unilateral or bilateral (on both sides of lip).\r\nCleft palate is an opening of the hard palate or soft palate (roof of the mouth) due to its incomplete fusion. It may also be unilateral or bilateral.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\nhttps://medlineplus.gov/cleftlipandpalate.html\r\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/cleftlip.html\r\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cleft-lip-and-palate/"

The diagnosis of cleft lip at birth is obvious whereas to rule out cleft palate, direct illuminated examination of the infant's hard and soft palate is done. Palpation of hard and soft palate is also done to ensure that a partial cleft is not missed.

                "As per WHO, Diarrhoea is defined as the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day (or more frequent passage than is normal for the individual). Frequent passing of formed stools is not diarrhoea, nor is the passing of loose, \"pasty\" stools by breastfed babies.\r\nIt is usually the symptom of gastrointestinal infection, which can be caused by a variety of viral, parasitic and bacteria organisms.As per UNICEF report, diarrhoeal diseases account for nearly 1.3 million deaths a year among children under-five years of age making them the second most common cause of child deaths worldwide. Over half of the deaths occur in just five countries: India, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Ethiopia. It is both preventable and treatable. Severe diarrhoea leads to fluid loss and may be life-threatening particularly in young children and people who are malnourished or have impaired immunity. Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water or from person to person as a result of poor hygiene. Diarrhoea caused by contaminated food or water while travelling is often known as traveller\u2019s diarrhoea."

In the later stages, the patient may not even be able to take care of self, and the illness affects the basic personal and social skills.\r\nAdvances in the medical field have been associated with increase in life expectancy leading to increasing number of old age population. As per the 2011 census, India is home to about 65 million people of age 65 and above, constituting 5.5% of the total population. Prevalence of dementia in India is reported to be 2.7%. As the age increase, prevalence of dementia increases. For example, nearly 20% of people above 80 suffer from dementia. Mean age of presentation is relatively younger at 66.3 years in India, about 10 years lesser than in the developed countries.\r\nUnlike the West, in India most of the elderly people live with their families and most patients with dementia are taken care of by the families.

                "One of the earliest symptoms of dementia is impairment of memory for recent events. Onset is usually slow and gradual, though it is sudden in vascular dementia. There is a progressive deterioration of various intellectual abilities. Often the family members observe that the patient starts forgetting about his daily use belongings, such as purse, pen or shoes and about recent events and whom he met the day before. He forgets about conversations, events of the day, telephone numbers, etc. A distinguishing feature is that the person himself is often not aware of this development. Interestingly, memory for remote events even going back to his early life is preserved.\r\nIn later stages, he may even forget names of close relatives, their occupations and places of stay. The patient may even have difficulty recalling the names of grandchildren. The progressive memory impairment may lead to faulty orientation to time and place. Symptoms often worsen at night. Ability to learn new tasks and skills gets impaired. In later stages, judgment also gets affected.\r\nIn the early phases, the patient may feel anxious and concerned over the memory disturbance, and may also feel depressed. But as the disturbance increases, the person does not accept memory loss. Sometimes it may progress on to suspiciousness. The patient may become impulsive and socially disinhibited. He may cut coarse jokes without caring for the consequences. In later stages, the patient may be unable to take care of his personal needs, may become sleepless and restless. He may get lost in surroundings familiar to him. In later stages, person may not even be able to take care of basic personal needs and need supervised care.\r\nFocal neurological deficits like fits, weakness of limbs or body, aphasia or dysarthria and failing vision may appear in later stages of dementia.\r\nBehavioural and psychological symptoms like apathy, depression, irritability, agitation/aggression are also common in subjects with dementia. Some patients may also develop paranoid symptoms and disorganized behaviour in later stages of illness.\r\nThus dementia often starts off with just memory problems, but later involves:\r\n\r\nDifficulty communicating (recognizing, identifying, naming, finding words to explain)\r\nDifficulty planning and carrying out day-to-day tasks (using household appliances like microwave or washing machine, leaving the gas stove on after cooking, etc)\r\nAbility to learn, reason, retain or recall past experience\r\nChanges in mood, personality and judgement\r\n\r\nDementia is differentiated from delirium, which is an acute illness characterized by altered sensorium or decreased level of consciousness, disorientation for time and place, fluctuating course with worsening in evening. Perceptual disturbances like illusions and hallucinations are characteristic features of delirium. Delirium is a medical emergency and is usually short lasting unlike dementia."

                "Dementia is a result of degenerative changes in the brain. The most common causes of dementia are Alzheimer\u2019s disease, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies. One study from India analyzing types of dementia found Alzheimer\u2019s disease in 38.3%, vascular dementia in 25.4%, fronto-temporal dementia in 18.7%, diffuse Lewy body disease in 8.9%, and mixed dementia in 8.6% of the patients. In dementia, the brain cells tend to degenerate and die more rapidly than the normal ageing process.\r\nSome of the important characteristics of these different types of dementia are discussed as below:\r\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease: Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common cause of dementia, contributing to about 40% cases of dementia in India. Loss of memory for recent events is initial manifestation, worsening slowly over time and involving other cognitive functions. Though there is difficulty in remembering the events that have happened recently, the patient is able to recall the events of remote past. The patient has also difficulty in recalling particular words and naming objects.\r\nFamily members would give history of the patient having:\r\n\r\nDifficulty in learning new things.\r\nDifficulty remembering appointments or phone messages.\r\nInability to remember the names of people or places and difficulty communicating with others.\r\nForgetting where they have put things of daily use like watch, purse, etc. The patient may also worry that someone has taken away.\r\nDenial of the memory problem, The person may attempt to cover up the deficit.\r\n\r\nCause lies in degenerative changes in the brain. The damaged tissue in brain builds up to form deposits called 'plaques' and 'tangles'. These cause brain cells around them to die.\r\nVascular dementia: Vascular dementia, also called multi infarct dementia, is the second commonest cause of dementia. Compared to the West, it is more common in India. It is usually caused by blockage in the blood vessels supplying the brain, leading to ischemia or infarct. MRI of brain would reveal multiple infarcts. Sometime vascular dementia develops after an attack of stroke. Memory disturbances come in form of step ladder pattern, increasing with a fresh infarct. Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes or high cholesterol.\r\nSome of the important characteristics of vascular dementia are:\r\n\r\nMemory loss and difficulty concentrating.\r\nLanguage problems like aphasia\r\nMood swings, depression\r\nEpisodes of confusion, aggressive behaviour, hallucinations\r\nPhysical deficits like paralysis or weakness of limbs\r\n\r\nBoth vascular dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease can also co-exist.\r\nLewy body dementia: Lewy body dementia is a relatively less common type of dementia, compared to the Alzheimer\u2019s disease and vascular dementia. It is characterized by development of protein deposits (Lewy bodies) building up in the brain. Some of the symptoms overlap with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease.\r\nCharacteristic features of Lewy body dementia are\r\n\r\nFluctuating level of attention and alertness\r\nVivid visual hallucinations (seeing human or animal figures)\r\nTrembling of hands, muscle stiffness, falls or difficulty with walking.\r\n\r\nFronto-temporal dementia: In fronto- temporal dementia, the front part of the brain consisting of frontal and temporal lobes is predominantly involved. It is slightly more common than Lewy body dementia. It is seen in relatively younger people compared to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and vascular dementia, usually starting in 50s and 60s. Personality deterioration, social disinhibition, and behavioural disorganization are common. A person, who was usually very polite and proper, might become irritable or rude. Memory may remain reasonably intact for a long time."

Sometimes, nutritional deficiencies or hypothyroidism may be responsible for the dementing changes. Once corrected, the memory disturbance improves. Similarly chronic alcohol use can also lead to dementia.\r\nA CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan) are also performed to detect the degenerative changes. Diagnosis of dementia is, however, mainly clinical."

                "Dementia, being a degenerative illness, is mostly untreatable. Investigations are generally performed to find out a treatable cause, which if identified (e.g., hypothyroidism, vitamin deficiency ), can be corrected. Certain measures like good nutrition, regular exercise and adequate sleep can improve the quality of life of the patient, and also help in slowing the progression of disease. Simplifying activities or modifying expectations to the cognitive and skill level of the patient can eliminate frustration. The home environment may need to be modified (lighting, positioning of bed, toilets, etc) to compensate for the patient's deficits.\r\nThe family members caring for the patient with dementia also face tremendous stress and burden in the care giving role and also need psychological support, guidance and help. They need to be educated about the problem and guided how to deal with it. Family therapy, group therapy and counselling are used to help them. Some of the NGOs like HelpAge India also run self help groups.\r\nCertain medications like donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine (also called cholinesterase inhibitors) are useful in early stages of the Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and slow down the progress of dementia. These increase the acetylcholine levels in the brain. Memantine is another drug which improves symptoms.\r\nIn vascular dementia, blood pressure needs to be kept under control and anticoagulant therapy is used to reduce the risk of further infarction."

The term \"Diabetes Mellitus\" describes a metabolic disorder of multiple etiology characterized by chronic hyperglycemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat (dyslipidaemia) and protein metabolism resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The main symptoms are: -\r\n\r\nPolyuria (frequent urination)\r\nPolydipsia (increased thirst)\r\nPolyphagia (increased hunger\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main types of diabetes are:\r\nType 1 diabetes: It is due to the body's malfunction to produce insulin in the body, and requires the person to inject insulin. This form was previously referred to as \"Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus\" (IDDM) or \"Juvenile Diabetes\".\r\nType 2 diabetes: It is due to insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail to use insulin properly, sometimes combined with an absolute insulin deficiency. This form was previously referred to as non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or \"adult-onset diabetes\".\r\nType 2 diabetes can be prevented after following healthy life style such as healthy diet, proper exercise or maintaining healthy weight.\r\nThe third main form, Gestational diabetes occurs when pregnant women without a previous diagnosis of diabetes develop a high blood glucose level. It may lead to type 2 DM.\r\nOther types of diabetes include those caused by:\r\n\r\nGenetic defects of the beta cells, (the part of the pancreas that makes insulin) such as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) or neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) \r\nDiseases of the pancreas or conditions that damage the pancreas, such as pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis\r\nExcess amounts of certain hormones resulting from some medical conditions such as cortisol in Cushing\u2019s syndrome that work against the action of insulin \r\nMedications that reduce insulin action, such as glucocorticoids, or chemicals that destroy beta cells"

Systems of diagnostic criteria for such an examination include Fried's diagnostic index which includes the following 8 signs:\r\n\r\nFlat face\r\nEar dysplasia\r\nTongue protrusion\r\nCorners of mouth turned down\r\nHypotonia\r\nNeck skin excess\r\nEpicanthic fold\r\nA gap between 1st and 2nd toes.\r\n\r\nWith 0 to 2 of these characteristics, the newborn can likely be said to not have Down syndrome (with less than one in 100 false negatives), with 3 to 5 of these characteristics, the situation is unclear (and genetic testing is recommended) and with 6 to 8 characteristics, the newborn can confidently be said to have Down syndrome (with less than one in 100.000 false positives).\r\n*NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any diagnosis/ treatment purpose please consult your physician."

It is characterised by insulin deficiency. Usually it has juvenile onset but may occur at any age. Patients are prone to ketoacidosis and weight loss.\r\nType II: This is known as non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or maturity onset diabetes mellitus. It occurs in middle aged/ older people who are often obese. There is impaired insulin secretion and/or insulin resistance. Patients may be managed with oral hypoglycaemic agents (drugs which lower blood sugar level). Patients may eventually need insulin especially those with ketonuria or dehydration. This does not mean that IDDM has developed.\r\nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterised by changes in retinal blood vessels that occur in patients with diabetes mellitus. DR is a retinal microangiopathy affecting arterioles, capillaries and the venules. However, larger vessels may be involved as well.\r\nCentral retina or macular area is located between main superior and inferior retinal artery and vein. The area beyond these main vessels is the peripheral retina.\r\nRetinopathy has features of both micro-vascular occlusion and micro-vascular leakage of plasma constituents due to breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier. Micro-vascular occlusion leads to arteriovenous shunts with capillary blockage and neovascularisation (new vessel formation). Micro-vascular leakage may cause haemorrhage and diffuse or localised retinal oedema. This disease can affect vision.\r\nDiabetic retinopathy is broadly divided as:\r\n- Background Diabetic retinopathy.\r\n- Pre-proliferative Diabetic retinopathy.\r\n- Proliferative Diabetic retinopathy (PDR)."

Glycosylated or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is a measure of glycaemic control over the last three months. Besides, patients have systemic features of Diabetes mellitus.\r\nFeatures of Background Diabetic retinopathy:\r\n- Micro-aneurysms: Micro-aneurysms appear as small round dots, usually seen temporal to the macula. Micro-aneurysms coated with blood are indistinguishable from dot haemorrhages.\r\n- Haemorrhages: Superficially placed haemorrhages appear as Flame-shaped haemorrhages. Haemorrhages in the deeper layers of retina appear as \u2018dot\u2019 and \u2018blot\u2019 haemorrhages.\r\n- Hard exudates: Exudates are composed of lipoprotein and lipid filled macrophages and typically surround leaking micro-vascular lesions and may take circinate (circular or ring shaped) pattern. These may be absorbed over a period of time.\r\n- Retinal oedema: Retinal oedema is characterised by retinal thickening which obscures underlying layers of retina. Fovea (point of retina through which an object is seen) may assume cystoid appearance due to progressive retinal oedema. Retinal oedema may present as \u2018macular oedema\u2019 or as \u2018clinically significant macular oedema\u2019.\r\nMacular oedema: Macular oedema is the presence of retinal thickening or hard exudates within one disc diameter (disc is the point of exit of optic nerve and is 1500\u00b5m in size) of the center of fovea.\r\nClinically significant macular oedema (CSMO): This is characterised by the presence of one or more of the following features.\r\n- Retinal oedema within 500\u00b5m of the center of fovea.\r\n- Hard exudates within 500\u00b5m of the fovea, associated with adjacent retinal thickening, which may be outside the limit of 500\u00b5m.\r\n- Retinal oedema of one disc diameter or larger, any part of which is within one disc diameter of the center of fovea.\r\n\r\nFeatures of Pre-proliferative Diabetic retinopathy: Retinal changes in Pre-proliferative DR are produced due to ischaemia and consists of:\r\n- Vascular appearance: Venules show beading, looping or sausage like segmentation. Arterioles may be narrowed or even obliterated.\r\n- Retinal infarcts: These appear as dark blot haemorrhages.\r\n- Cotton wool spots: Ischaemia due to capillary occlusion may cause damage to nerve fiber layer appearing as cotton wool spots in multiple areas.\r\n- Intra-retinal micro-vascular abnormality (IRMA): IRMAs are located within retina and do not cross major retinal blood vessels. These appear similar to flat retinal neovascularisation.\r\n\r\nProliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR): PDR is more common in IDDM and show features of:\r\n- Neovascularisation: New vessels may appear on the optic nerve head (new vessels at disc or NVD) or along major temporal vessels (new vessels elsewhere or NVE). Over one-quarter of the retina has to be non-perfused before NVD develops. Later, there may be formation of fibro-vascular epiretinal membrane in the potential vitreoretinal space.\r\n- Vitreous detachment or separation: Formation of fibro-vascular epiretinal membrane in potential vitreoretinal space may lead to total or partial posterior vitreous detachment. The fibro-vascular tissue may become adherent to posterior vitreous face. Pull on fibro-vascular tissue by the vitreous detachment may lead to haemorrhage in vitreoretinal space or within the vitreous. PDR is asymptomatic until the onset of vitreous haemorrhage.\r\n- Haemorrhage: Haemorrhage may occur in potential vitreoretinal space (retrohyaloid space) as pre-retinal haemorrhage or into the vitreous gel (intravitreal haemorrhage).Intravitreal (Intra-gel) haemorrhage takes longer to clear as compared to pre-retinal haemorrhage. Pre-retinal haemorrhage takes crescentic shape along the posterior vitreous detachment.\r\nComplications of Proliferative Diabetic retinopathy: PDR may lead to retinal detachment, persistent vitreous haemorrhage, rubeosis iridis (formation of new vessels on iris) or formation of opaque membrane on posterior surface of detached vitreous.\r\n\r\nLaboratory tests for Diabetic Retinopathy:\r\n- Fluorescein Angiography (FA): Fluorescein is a fluorescent dye. Fluorescein Angiography helps in assessing degree of retinal ischaemia and delineates retinal vascular abnormalities. Microaneurysms appear as hyper-fluorescent spots which leaks the dye in late phases of FA. \u2018Blot\u2019 and \u2018Dot\u2019 haemorrhages appear hypo-fluorescent in contrast to micro-aneurysms. Nonperfused areas appear as dark patches or homogeneous hypo-fluorescent areas. NVD and NVE also show leakage of dye on FA. Intra-retinal micro-vascular abnormalities do not leak dye.\r\n- Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): OCT generates cross-sectional image of the retina with light. OCT helps in measuring retinal thickening. Periodic OCT determine whether the retinal thickening in macular area due to oedema is regressing or not with treatment. Any vitreomacular traction can also be assessed.\r\n- B-scan ultrasonography: B-scan ultrasonography evaluates retina when the media is not clear e.g. vitreous haemorrhage.\r\n\r\nDiabetic retinopathy should be distinguished from conditions like retinal vein occlusion, retinal vasculitis, sickle cell retinopathy or ocular ischaemic syndrome."

The technique of laser photocoagulation may be:-\r\n- Direct laser photocoagulation: Laser burns are applied to microaneurysms and micro-vascular lesions in the center of hard exudates located between 500\u00b5m to 3000\u00b5m from center of the fovea.\r\n- Grid photocoagulation: Grid photocoagulation is applied in areas of diffuse retinal thickening located at posterior pole of eye, 500\u00b5m each from the center of the fovea and from the temporal margin of the optic disc.\r\nPre-proliferative Diabetic retinopathy: Photocoagulation is done when fluorescein angiography shows extensive areas of capillary non-perfusion in patients who had proliferative DR in the fellow eye.\r\nProliferative Diabetic retinopathy: Patients with high risk of vision loss should be treated. Features of high risk are:-\r\n- NVD or neovascularisation more than one-quarter disc in area within 1500\u00b5m of the disc.\r\n- Less extensive NVD associated with vitreous or retrohyaloid haemorrhage.\r\n- NVE more than one-half disc in size associated with vitreous or retrohyaloid haemorrhage. \r\nPanretinal Photocoagulation (PRP) is given in scatter pattern extending from posterior fundus to the peripheral retina.\r\nRecurrence is further treated with photocoagulation or cryotherapy. \r\nSurgical management in the form of pars plana vitrectomy may be done in complicated cases like persistent vitreous haemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment or rubeosis iridis."

                "Duane retraction syndrome is characterised by retraction of globe (eyeball) on attempted adduction (inward movement) caused due to co-contraction of both medial and lateral rectus muscle of the involved eye.\r\nDuane retraction syndrome is a non-progressive congenital disorder of eye movement, which may occur either in isolation or in the form of syndrome associated with other congenital defects, most common is perceptive deafness with associated speech disorder. It may be associated with strabismus in primary gaze.\r\nHorizontal eye movement is governed by lateral rectus muscle, which pulls the eye outward and by medial rectus muscle, which pulls the eye inward. When lateral rectus muscle of an eye contracts and pull the eyeball outward, the medial rectus of the same eye relaxes. The contra-lateral medial rectus muscle contracts and the lateral rectus muscle relaxes to a similar extent for smooth movement of eyeballs.\r\nClassification:\r\nThere are three main types (Huber classification):\r\n- Type 1: This is characterised by limitation or absence of abduction (outward movement) with normal or mildly restricted adduction. This is the most common type.\r\n- Type 2: This is characterised by limited adduction with normal or mildly restricted abduction. This is the least common type.\r\n- Type 3: This type shows limitation of both abduction and adduction."

Stagnation of tears due to blockage of lacrimal drainage system can result in dacryocystitis.\r\nLacrimal drainage system consists of:-\r\nPunctum (plural puncta): Punctum is located near the medial (inner) end of each eyelid and it joins vertical canaliculus.\r\nVertical canaliculus (plural canaliculi): Vertical canaliculus, also known as ampulla (plural ampulae) is about 2mm in length and it continues with horizontal canaliculus.\r\nHorizontal canaliculus: Horizontal canaliculus is about 8mm in length. Canaliculus from upper and lower eyelid joins to form common canaliculus in about 90% of cases. A small flap of mucosa (valve of Rosenmuller) overhangs at the opening of common canaliculus into the lateral wall of lacrimal sac.\r\nLacrimal sac: Lacrimal sac is about 10mm long and lies in lacrimal fossa near medial canthus (where upper and lower lid meet internally) of the eye. It continues as nasolacrimal duct.\r\nNasolacrimal duct: Nasolacrimal duct is about 12mm long and joins lacrimal sac with the nasal cavity (nasolacrimal duct opens into the inferior meatus of the nose). The opening of the duct is partially covered by a mucosal fold known as valve of Hasner.\r\n\r\nThe contraction and expansion of lacrimal sac with each blink (being governed by action of orbicularis muscle) results in movement of tears from eyes to the nose.\r\nExcessive watering from the eyes may be due to:-\r\n- Lacrimation: Lacrimation is caused by reflex overproduction of tears due to irritation of the cornea or conjunctiva.\r\n- Obstructive epiphora: Obstructive epiphora is due to mechanical obstruction of the drainage of tears.\r\n- Lacrimal pump failure: Lacrimal pump failure is due to lax lower lid or weakness of orbicularis muscle.\r\n\r\nDacryocystitis may be congenital or acquired.\r\nCongenital dacryocystitis is usually due to non-canalisation of the nasolacrimal duct.\r\nAcquired dacryocystitis may be acute or chronic.\r\nAcute dacryocystitis is characterised by sudden onset of acute pain and redness in the medial canthal area.\r\nChronic dacryocystitis is characterised by chronic inflammation or infection of the lacrimal sac resulting in epiphora (watering from the eye)."

Prolonged retention of dye usually more than 5 minutes indicate delayed drainage.\r\n- Primary Jones dye test: It differentiates partial obstruction of lacrimal passages from primary hypersecretion of tears. Fluorescein dye is instilled in conjunctival sac and its recovery from nose is assessed. Fluorescein may be recovered from nose in primary hypersecretion. Non recovery of fluorescein from nose may be due to partial obstruction or failure of lacrimal pump.\r\n- Secondary Jones dye test: It identifies the probable site of partial obstruction. Topical anaesthetic drops are instilled and residual fluorescein is washed out from conjunctival sac. The drainage system is then irrigated using normal saline. Recovery of fluorescein stained saline from nose indicates partial obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct. If unstained saline is obtained from the nose, it may be due to partial obstruction of the upper drainage system (punctum, canaliculus or common canaliculus) or may be due to defective lacrimal pump.\r\n- Nasal endoscopy: This may help in ruling out hypertrophy of inferior turbinate, any deviation of nasal septum or narrowing of inferior meatus.\r\nHistological examination:\r\nThere may be chronic inflammation and fibrosis in lacrimal sac.\r\nLacrimal sac may also show loss of goblet cells, focal ulceration, abscess or granuloma formation.\r\nNasolacrimal duct and nasal mucosa may also show signs of chronic inflammation and fibrosis."

                "Dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease) is a parasitic disease caused byDracunculus medinensis that is a long, thread-like worm. Dracunculiasis is commonly known as guinea-worm disease (GW). It is transmitted exclusively when people drink stagnant water contaminated with parasite-infected water fleas (Cyclops- that carry infective guinea-worm larvae).\r\nDracunculiasis is rarely fatal, but infected people become crippled, non-functional for weeks. It affects people in rural, deprived and isolated communities who depend mainly on open surface water sources such as ponds for drinking water.\r\nAn estimated 3.5 million cases of dracunculiasis occurred during the mid-1980s in 21 countries worldwide, 17 countries of which were in Africa. The number of reported cases fell to only 22 cases globally in 2015 (lowest number of cases so far) compared with 126 cases in 2014. In 2015, cases were reported from four endemic countries - Chad (9), Mali (5), South Sudan (5) and Ethiopia (3). World Health Organization (WHO) has certified 198 countries, territories and areas (belonging to 186 Member States) as free of dracunculiasis.\r\nIn India the GW disease was endemic in 89 districts in seven states. Almost two-thirds of the total cases during 1984 occurred in Rajasthan (38%) and Madhya Pradesh (29%). Karnataka (13%), Andhra Pradesh (11%), Maharashtra (8%) and Gujarat (1%) accounted for the remaining cases. After implementation of National Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP) by the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare, Government of India in 1983-84, the last case of GW disease was reported in 1996. Disease has been eradicated and India was declared as guinea worm disease free country by WHO in 2000.\r\nAs global eradication of guinea worm disease has not been achieved, the States (previously endemic for GW disease) are continuing the routine surveillance for the disease till global eradication is achieved."

The water fleas are killed in the stomach and the larvae are liberated. These larvae penetrate the wall of the intestine and migrate through the body.\r\nThe fertilized female worm (which measures from 60\u2013100 cm long) migrates under the skin tissues until it reaches its exit point, usually at the lower limbs.\r\nA blister or swelling is formed at exit point from which parasite emerges."

                "Disability is a global public health problem as people with disability, throughout the life course, face widespread barriers in accessing health and related services, such as rehabilitation, and has worse health outcomes than people without disability. Disability is any continuing condition that restricts everyday activities. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) defines disability as an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. Impairment is a problem in body function or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action; participation restriction is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations.\r\nDisability is not just a health problem; it is the interaction between individuals with a health condition and personal and environmental factors (such as negative attitudes, inaccessible transportation and public buildings, and limited social supports). Overcoming the difficulties faced by people with disabilities requires interventions to remove environmental and social barriers.\r\nOver 1 billion people, about 15% of the world's population have some form of disability. Of this number 110 million to 190 million people of 15 years and older have significant difficulties in functioning and 93 million people less than 15 years of age live with a moderate or severe disability.\r\nIn India according to the Census 2011, 2.2% of population had some form of disability. The prevalence of disability was found to be more in rural areas (2.24%) as compared to urban areas (2.17%) and more among males (2.4%) than among females (2%). The proportion of different types of disability among people with disability reported as: (i) seeing 18.8%, (ii) hearing 18.9% (iii) speech 7.5% (iv) movement 20.3% (v) mental retardation 7.6% (vi) mental illness 2.7%, (vii) multiple disabilities 7.9% (viii) Any other 18.4%.\r\nIn the coming years, prevalence of disability will continue to increase due to increase in ageing populations and with the global increase in chronic health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental health disorders, injuries, car crashes, falls, violence. \r\nAll people with disabilities have the same general health care needs as everyone else; however they have greater unmet health care needs than people without disabilities. Evidence suggests that people with disabilities face barriers in accessing the health and rehabilitation services they need in many settings. According to World Health organization (WHO) estimates:\r\n\r\n200 million people need glasses or other low vision devices and do not have access to them.\r\n70 million people need a wheelchair, only 5-15% have access to one.\r\n360million people globally have moderate to profound hearing loss and only 10% of global needs of hearing aids are met.\r\nHalf of the people with disabilities cannot afford health care.\r\n\r\nPeople with disabilities have generally poorer health, lower education levels, fewer economic opportunities and higher rates of poverty than people without disability. This is due to many obstacles they face in their everyday life and due to lack of services available to them.\r\nDisability is now understood to be a human rights issue. People are disabled by society, not just by their bodies. These barriers can be overcome, if governments, nongovernmental organizations, professionals and people with disabilities and their families work together."

Disability in speech/speech disability: A person is unable to speak like normal persons.\r\niii. Disability in hearing/hearing disability: A person may have problem in hearing day to day conversational speech when hearing aid is not used. A person may have the following degrees of hearing disability:\r\n\r\nA person, who does not hear at all or can only hear very loud sounds like thunder and crackers, is considered to have profound disability.\r\nA person who can hear speech only when spoken to very loudly, near the ear is considered to have severe disability.\r\nperson often asks for repetitions when spoken to or needs to see the face of the person who is speaking is considered to have moderate disability.\r\nA person who has difficulty in hearing but it does not interfere in day today conversation is considered to have mild disability.\r\n\r\n(A person who has problem only in one ear is not considered as having hearing disability).\r\niv. Disability in movement/ locomotor disability\r\n(a) Loss or absence or inactivity of whole or part of hand or leg or both (due to amputation, paralysis, cerebral palsy, deformity or dysfunction of joints) which affects his/her \u201cnormal ability to move self or objects\u201d and\r\n(b) those with physical deformities in the body (other than limbs), such as, hunch back, deformed spine regardless of whether the same caused loss or lack of normal movement of body are considered as disable with locomotor disability. Thus, dwarfs and persons with stiff neck of permanent nature who generally do not have difficulty in the normal movement of body and limbs are also to be treated as disabled.\r\nv. Mental disability A mentally disabled person has difficulty in understanding routine instructions or does not carry out his/ her activities like others of similar age or exhibited behaviours like talking to self, laughing/crying, staring, violence, fear and suspicion without reason. The mentally disabled are categorized into two groups viz. mentally retarded and mentally ill. If persons with mental disability manifests this behaviour since birth/ childhood but before 18 years of age and the person was late in talking, sitting, standing or walking, they are classified as \u2018mentally retarded\u2019. The remaining mentally disabled persons are classified as \u2018mentally ill\u2019\r\nvi. Leprosy Cured Persons who have been cured of leprosy and are having extreme physical deformity as well as advanced age which prevents him from undertaking any gainful occupation."

One study indicated that adults with developmental disabilities had a similar or greater rate of chronic health conditions such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes (due to increased physical inactivity) than people without disabilities.\r\nAge-related conditions: The ageing process for some groups of people with disabilities begins earlier than usual and they may experience age related health conditions (such as osteoporosis, loss of strength and balance) more frequently.\r\nRisk behaviours: People with disabilities have higher rates of engaging in risky behaviours such as smoking, alcohol conumption, poor diet and physical inactivity as compare to general population.\r\nViolence :People with disabilities are at greater risk of violence than those without disabilities.\r\nUnintentional injury: People with disabilities are at higher risk of unintentional injury from road traffic crashes, burns, falls, and accidents related to assistive devices.\r\nAssistive technologies and assistive devices such as crutches, prostheses, wheelchairs, and tricycles in mobility impairments; hearing aids and cochlear implants for hearing impairments; ocular devices, talking books, and software for screen magnification and reading for people with visual impairments may be advised according to the user and the user\u2019s environment.\r\nRehabilitation: It is an important aspect of management for people with disability.

                "Distichiasis is a congenital or acquired condition in which there is an accessory row of cilia behind the normal row of eyelash cilia. This disorder may be familial in origin with an autosomal dominant inheritance, but may also be produced by acquired conditions such as severe inflammation or trauma. It is presumed to be due to differentiation of primary epithelial germ cells originally destined for development of meibomian or tarsal glands. Meibomian glands are modified sebaceous glands located in the tarsal plate of eyelids. In skin, pilo-sebaceous unit consists of sebaceous glands associated with hair follicle and sweat gland. It is believed that meibomian gland may undergo differentiation into primitive pilo-sebaceous unit which produces distichiasis.\r\nThe roots of eyelashes (cilias) lie against the anterior surface of the tarsal plate. The cilia come out of skin at the anterior lid margin and curve away from the globe. The lid margin from anterior to posterior comprises of\r\n\r\nEyelashes.\r\nGrey line (border between anterior (lash, skin and orbicularis oculi muscle) and posterior (tarsal plate and conjunctiva) lamella.\r\nMeibomian gland orifices.\r\nMucocutaneous junction.\r\nConjunctiva.\r\n\r\nDistichiasis may present only a few isolated eyelashes, or as a complete accessory second row of lashes.

                "Double Elevator Palsy refers to limited elevation of one eye in adduction, primary gaze, and abduction. The term double elevator refers to both the elevators of an eye i.e. superior rectus and inferior oblique muscle. However, there are cases in which deficient elevation is produced by tight inferior rectus muscle. Due to this, Double elevator palsy is included under restrictive strabismus. Now Double elevator palsy is known by a more descriptive term as Monocular Elevation Deficit Syndrome (MED).This is distinguished from Brown\u2019s syndrome in which elevation is restricted much more in adduction rather than in abduction.\r\nThis condition presents as hypotropia when the patient fixates with normal non-paretic eye. Chin elevation and ptosis/pseudoptosis are often present. Fixation with the paretic eye produces hypertropia of the normal non-paretic eye. Ptosis also disappears since it is not due to paresis of levator palpebrae superioris muscle.\r\nWhite (1942) described a congenital deficiency of upgaze associated with hypotropia and ptosis of the affected paretic eye. Dunlap (1952) to describe the weakness affecting both elevators of involved eye coined the term Double elevator palsy.\r\nDouble elevator palsy may be associated with certain innervational conditions such as\r\n\r\nJaw-winking ptosis\r\nDuane\u2019s retraction syndrome\r\nOther misdirection strabismus syndromes"

Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) may be present. Upward and outward rolling of eyeballs or Bell\u2019s phenomenon is often preserved.\r\nSince elevation is preserved in Bell\u2019s phenomenon, DVD or under anaesthesia, several authors believe it to be a supranuclear disorder. Others discuss it to be a fascicular lesion. Long lasting palsy of superior rectus alone may impede elevation in adduction, thus nuclear origin of superior rectus may be a factor. Even primary fibrotic origin is presumed in cases showing resistance to forced duction test.\r\nThus supranuclear, nuclear, fascicular and muscular causes are discussed for double elevator palsy.\r\nCerebrovascular diseases such as hypertension, thromboembolism, and arteritis usually cause acquired cases.

                "Diagnosis depends upon history and clinical examination.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nIn congenital MED, history of onset of symptoms and its association with other features is important. The presence of associated amblyopia points to congenital aetiology.\r\nIn acquired MED, history of associated neurological features (ataxia, vertigo, tinnitus, loss of consciousness) is important. History of malignancy or cardiovascular disorder is also important.\r\n\r\nClinical examination\r\nClinical examination distinguishes between MED due to primary superior rectus palsy, any cause of supranuclear superior rectus weakness, or primary/secondary inferior rectus restriction.\r\nPrimary superior rectus palsy or paresis: It is characterised by a forced duction test showing no restriction to full upward rotation. Bell\u2019s phenomenon is not present.\r\nSupranuclear superior rectus weakness: This is usually congenital and is characterised by monocular absence of vertical eye movements in superior field of gaze. There is no resistance to upward gaze in forced duction test. Bell\u2019s phenomenon is present.\r\nPatients with primary inferior rectus restriction or fibrosis: This group of patients often do not have hypotropia in primary gaze. Forced duction test shows restriction to upward rotation because of inferior rectus restriction. Superior rectus palsy or supranuclear disorders may produce secondary contracture in inferior rectus. Hypotropia and ptosis are usually present. Forced duction test shows inferior rectus restriction.\r\n\r\nCongenital MED\r\n\r\nEyes: Classically MED present with unilateral limitation of upgaze above horizontal midline with accompanying ptosis. Limitation in upgaze is same whether in adduction or abduction. The affected eye is hypotropic. Ptosis is most noticeable when the nonparetic eye fixes and the paretic eye is hypotropic. Pseudoptosis occurs when the eyelid is passively drawn down in hypotropic eye. It resolves when paretic eye takes up fixation. True ptosis does not resolve when paretic eye takes up fixation. In cases with associated ptosis and pseudoptosis together, ptosis improves in part when the paretic eye takes up fixation in primary position.\r\nHead posture: Depending upon degree of binocularity and fixation preference, variable head postures are observed in MED. A patient with hypotropia and having some degree of fusion, usually tilts head back in chin up position to maintain binocularity. Cases with no hypotropia or hypotropic eye is also amblyopic, adopts a normal head posture. Rarely, patient may fixate with affected eye, producing large secondary hypertropia in the nonparetic eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquired MED\r\n\r\nEyes: It is characterised by acute onset of diplopia in both primary position and upward gaze. Limitation of upgaze is same in both adduction and abduction. Ptosis is usually absent. There may be associated abnormalities of pupil, paresis in downgaze, and convergence weakness. Bell\u2019s phenomenon is usually present unless it is affected by secondary restriction of inferior rectus muscle.\r\nHead position: Often patient assumes chin up position to maintain binocularity and thus decreasing diplopia.\r\n\r\n\r\nInvestigations\r\nBesides regular blood tests, following tests may be done\r\n\r\nChest radiography\r\nComputed tomography\r\nCerebral angiography\r\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the brain stem\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis\r\nDifferential diagnosis of congenital MED includes conditions such as\r\n\r\nBrown superior oblique syndrome\r\nCongenital fibrosis of inferior rectus muscle\r\nCongenital absence of superior rectus muscle with or without absence of inferior oblique muscle\r\nVertical Duane co-contraction syndrome\r\nThird cranial nerve palsy with involvement of superior branch\r\nAnomalous insertion of superior or inferior rectus muscle\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis of acquired MED includes conditions such as\r\n\r\nDysthyroid orbitopathy\r\nMyasthenia gravis\r\nFracture of orbital floor with muscle entrapment\r\nLesions affecting superior branch of oculomotor nerve\r\nProgressive external ophthalmoplegia\r\nOrbital cellulitis\r\nOrbital inflammatory disease\r\nSystemic amyloidosis with extraocular muscle infiltration\r\nLabyrinthine disorders\r\nCerebellar tumours"

It proposes that during a woman's menstrual flow, some of the endometrial debris exits the uterus through the fallopian tubes and attaches itself to the peritoneal surface (the lining of the abdominal cavity) where it can proceed to invade the tissue as endometriosis.\r\nEnvironmental factors: Another reason for endometriosis is certain toxins in the environment, such as dioxins (chemical byproducts), affecting the body and its immune system.\r\nGenetic factors: Endometriosis is sometimes believed to be heritable i.e. being passed down through the genes of family members. It is more common in Asian women than in white women. This phenomenonsuggests that genes may also play a part.\r\nIt can also spread through the bloodstream or lymphatic system:Endometriosis cells are believed to get into the bloodstream or lymphatic system (a network of tubes, glands and organs that is part of the body's defense against infection). This theory could explain how, in very rare cases, the cells are found in remote places such as the eyes or brain."

This allows the doctor to reach and remove growths of endometriosis in the pelvis or abdomen.\r\nHysterectomyis a surgery in which the doctor removes the uterus.

                "As per WHO, epilepsy is a chronic disorder characterized by recurrent seizures which mayvary from a brief lapse of attention or muscle jerks, to severe and prolonged convulsions.\r\nThe seizures are caused by sudden, usually brief, excessive electrical discharges in a group of brain cells (neurons). In most cases, epilepsy can be successfully treated with anti-epileptic drugs. Epilepsy is a chronic non communicable disorder of the brain that affects people of all ages. WHO statistics shows that around 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy. It is very common in India especially in children."

                "The main symptoms of epilepsy are repeated seizures. There are many different types ofseizures, depending on the area of the brain affected. Seizures can be classified into 2categories depending on how much of the brain is affected. There are:\r\n\r\nPartial seizures \u2013 Where only a small part of the brain is affected\r\n\r\nGeneralized seizures \u2013 Where most or all of the brain is affected. It is more common inchildren.\r\n\r\nSymptoms of partial seizure include:\r\n\r\nChanges in the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound\r\nAn intense feeling that events have happened before (d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu)\r\nTingling sensation, or \u2018pins and needles\u2019, in arms and legs\r\nA sudden intense emotion, such as fear or joy\r\nThe muscles in arms, legs and face may become stiff\r\nExperience twitching on one side of your body\r\n\r\nThere are six main types of generalized seizure:\r\n\r\n1) Absence seizure: This mainly affect children. It causes the child to lose awareness of hissurroundings for up to 20-30 seconds. The child will seem to stare vacantly into space,though some children might flutter their eyes or smack their lips. The child will have nomemory of the seizure. Absences can occur several times a day. Although they are notdangerous, they may affect the child's performance.\r\n\r\n2) Myoclonic jerks: It is types of seizures that cause arms, legs or upper body to jerk ortwitch, much like an electric shock. It often only last for a fraction of a second.Myoclonic jerks often happen in the first few hours after waking up and can occur incombination with other types of generalized seizures.\r\n\r\n3) Clonic seizure: It causes the same sort of twitching as myoclonic jerks, except thesymptoms last longer, normally up to two minutes. The patient may get unconscious\r\n\r\n4) Atonic seizure: It cause all muscles to relax, so there is a chance to fall on the ground.Facial injuries are common with this type of seizure.\r\n\r\n5) Tonic seizure: Unlike an atonic seizure, tonic seizures cause all the muscles to suddenlybecome stiff. That can result in loss of balance and fall over, so injuries to the back of thehead are common in this type of seizure.\r\n\r\n6) Tonic-clonic seizure: It is known as grand mal, has two stages. In this body becomesstiff and then arms and legs begins twitching. Patient loses consciousness. The seizurenormally lasts between one and three minutes, but can last longer."

                "Exact cause of epilepsy is still unknown but it is thought that it results from excess neuronal firing/activity. Epilepsy is caused when there are disruptions to the normal connections between nerve cells in the brain (much like disruptions in wiring of a complex electrical circuit), when there are imbalances of natural chemicals or neurotransmitters that are important to the signaling among nerve cells, or when there are changes in the membranes of nerve cells, including proteins called ion channels, that alter their normal sensitivity.p\r\nSome of these disruptions, imbalances, and changes may develop early in life, sometimes related to early exposures and events and sometimes related to hereditary factors.\r\nThere are three main categories of epilepsy:\r\nMetabolic/ structural epilepsy There is a known cause for a person\u2019s epilepsy, such as a head injury, infections, birth hypoxia etc.\r\nIdiopathic epilepsy \u2013 No apparent cause for epilepsy can be found despite investigations.\r\nEpilepsy due to unknown cause like idiopathic epilepsy, no apparent cause can be found. However, there is strong evidence that this type of epilepsy may be the result of brain damage. Status epilepticus: Any seizure lasting for more than 5 minutes is defined as a status epilepticus and the PWE must be rushed to hospital or emergency medication be given as prescribed by the doctor by nose etc, this is a medical emergency."

                "The diagnosis of epilepsy usually requires that the seizures should occur spontaneously.Other precipitants can trigger an epileptic seizure in patients who otherwise would be susceptible to spontaneous seizures commonest are missing epilepsy medication dose, lack ofsleep, stress, taking certain medication which may precipitate seizures. Rarely certain epilepsy syndromes require particular triggers for seizures to occur. These are termed reflex epilepsy. For example, patients with primary reading epilepsy have seizures triggered by reading Photosensitive epilepsy can be limited to seizures triggered by flashing lights.\r\nDiagnostic methods:\r\nMagnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI): An MRI scan can often detect possible causes of epilepsy, such as defects in the structure of your brain or the presence of a brain tumor. For epilepsy, an epilepsy protocol MRI should be done. This test is not painful.\r\nElectroencephalograph (EEG): An EEG test measures the electrical activity of the brain through electrodes placed on the scalp. During the test, patient may be asked to breathe deeply or close the eyes, as these actions could reveal unusual brain activity associated with epilepsy. Patient might also be asked to look at a flashing light, but the test will be stopped immediately if it looks like the flashing light could trigger a seizure.This test is not painful.\r\nYour diagnosis may vary so it is advisable to consult your physician for further diagnosis."

However, it hasbeen stressed that accurate differentiation between generalized and partial seizures isespecially important in determining the appropriate treatment. The mainstay of treatment ofepilepsy is anti convulsant medications. However many a times it has certain effect on qualityof life.\r\n\r\nMedications : The older first-line Anti-epileptic drugs include sodium valproate,carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital. Newer AEDs include lamotrigine,levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, topamax, gabapentin, and vigabatrin. Side effectsmay occur and these medicines must be taken under supervision. They must not be stoppedabruptly. There is nothing such as a course for epilepsy and medicines must be regularlyconsumed till the doctor advises.\r\n\r\nSurgery : Epilepsy surgery is also done in case of focal seizures that are resistant to thetreatment. Treatment resistance is defined as seizures persisting despite regular medication ofat least 2 anticonvulsants in adequate doses with adequate adherence, provided pseudo seizures havebeen ruled out.\r\n\r\nElectrical stimulation: by Vagus Nerve stimulation and deep brain stimulation is done butmay not result in complete seizure control.\r\nAll persons with epilepsy must carry a seizure frist aid card.\r\n\r\nSEIZURE FIRST AID: NAME            \r\nADDRESS\r\nMOBILE NOS:\r\nIN EMERGENCY CONTACT:\r\n\r\nDos and donts during a convulsion:\r\n\r\n\r\nDo's\r\nDon't\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

It has many features similar to involutional entropion like it affects the lower lid of elderly patients and the ageing changes for both are similar. Following age related changes contribute to involutional ectropion.\r\n- Horizontal lid laxity leads to excessive eyelid length.\r\n- Tarsoligamentous sling which support the eyelid by attachment to the orbital rim via canthal tendons (both medial and lateral) is lax. Medial and lateral canthal tendons are also known as medial and lateral palpebral ligaments respectively. (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/834932-overview#a6)\r\n- Weakness of pre-tarsal orbicularis oculi.\r\n    Chronic pressure of ocular prosthesis in anophthalmic (absence of eyeball) socket may produce involutional ectropion.\r\nCicatricial ectropion:\r\nCicatricial ectropion is caused due to scarring or contracture of skin and underlying tissues. Anterior lamella comprising of skin and orbicularis oculi muscle is shortened. This leads to pulling away of the eyelid from the globe.\r\nImportant causes include:-\r\n- Tumours\r\n- Facial burns\r\n- Trauma.\r\n- Excessive skin excision or laser burn in blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery).\r\nParalytic ectropion:\r\nParalytic ectropion may occur with palsy of seventh cranial nerve. Paralytic ectropion is caused by decreased tone of orbicularis oculi muscle due to its involvement in seventh cranial nerve palsy.\r\nImportant causes of seventh cranial nerve palsy are:-\r\n- Bell palsy.\r\n- Parotid gland infiltration or tumour.\r\n- Cerebellopontine angle mass.\r\n- Herpes zoster oticus.\r\nCongenital ectropion:\r\nCongenital ectropion is a rare bilateral condition. Often the cause is vertical deficiency of anterior lamella.\r\nCongenital ectropion may occur in isolation or may be associated with other conditions such as:-\r\n- Blepharophimosis syndrome.\r\n- Buphthalmos (Enlarged eyeball due to congenital glaucoma).\r\n- Microphthalmos (small eyeball).\r\n- Orbital cyst.\r\n- Down syndrome.\r\n    Mechanical ectropion may occur with lid tumours such as neurofibromas.\r\nRisk factors for Ectropion:\r\nCertain factors contribute in development of ectropion such as:-\r\n- Frequent rubbing of eyelids.\r\n- Repeated pulling of eyelids (e.g. as in contact lens wearer).\r\n- Loss of lid elasticity with ageing.\r\n- Skin conditions involving eyelids.\r\n- Prior eyelid surgery.\r\n- Long term use of eye drops such as dorzolamide and brimodine.\r\n- Inflammatory skin conditions involving eyelids.\r\n- Trauma.\r\n- Midfacial hypoplasia."

Involutional ectropion disappears with this manoeuvre.\r\n- Eyelid distraction test: Eyelid distraction test is done by pulling the lid away from the globe. Normal lid distraction is between 2-3mm. In horizontal lid laxity, distraction is more than 5mm.\r\n- Snap back test: Examiner pulls lower lid inferiorly and observe the lid returning to its original position without allowing patient to blink. Normally, lid returns back quickly without blinking, but in increased laxity, blink may be needed for its return to normal position.\r\nCicatricial ectropion:\r\n- Horizontal lid laxity: Horizontal lid laxity may be assessed by placing the thumb beneath lateral canthus and pushing the eyelid laterally and superiorly. If the lower lid margin does not extend 2mm above the lower limbus, then cicatricial ectropion is considered.\r\n- In cicatricial ectropion, eyelid malposition often becomes accentuated by asking the patient to look upward and open mouth at the same time. By this manoeuvre, anterior lamella is maximally stretched.\r\nParalytic ectropion: \r\n- Signs of seventh cranial nerve palsy such as weakness of facial muscles, disparity between spontaneous and voluntary closure of eyelid, presence or absence of Bell phenomenon and inability to close the eyelids may be present.\r\n- Exposure keratopathy caused by incomplete blinking and lagophthalmos (inability to close the eyelids).\r\n- Epiphora produced by failure of lacrimal pump mechanism and increase in tear production due to corneal exposure.\r\n- Eyelid retraction.\r\n- Deformity such as brow ptosis.\r\nCongenital ectropion:\r\n- Congenital ectropion may show features of associated disease such as Blepharophimosis syndrome, microphthalmos (small eyeball) or Down syndrome.\r\n    Mechanical ectropion will show features of associated tumour.\r\nEctropion should be differentiated from conditions like:-\r\n- Eyelid retraction secondary to proptosis.\r\n-    Eyelid malignancy e.g. basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma."

Following age related changes contribute to involutional entropion.\r\n- Overriding of pre-septal over the pre-tarsal part of orbicularis oculi muscle, during closure of eyelids. This moves the lower border of the tarsus away from the globe and the upper border toward the globe.\r\n- Horizontal lid laxity produced by thinning and atrophy of the tarsus and the canthal tendons. Due to this laxity, middle part of lower lid when pulled away from the globe does not snap back to its normal position.\r\n- Weakness of the lower lid retractors which can be assessed clinically by decreased excursion of the lower lid in down-gaze.\r\n- Involution of the soft tissues of the orbit, particularly fat, may cause enophthalmos (deep seated eyes), which in turn lead to unstable eyelid position and entropion.\r\nCicatricial Entropion:\r\nCicatricial entropion is usually due to scarring of palpebral conjunctiva, which pull lid margin towards the eyeball. It is usually secondary to systemic and progressive inflammatory conditions.\r\nConditions which may lead to cicatricial entropion are:-\r\n- Trachoma.\r\n- Chemical burns of conjunctiva.\r\n- Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.\r\n- Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\r\n- Trauma.\r\n- Iatrogenic (induced inadvertently by medical professionals) e.g. following surgery, radiation therapy or use of chemotherapeutic drugs.\r\nAcute Spastic Entropion:\r\nAcute spastic entropion is produced due to spasm of orbicularis oculi muscle.\r\nIt may be:-\r\n- Due to ocular irritation caused by infection, inflammation as in blepharitis, or trauma.\r\n- Iatrogenic e.g. produced by surgical trauma.\r\n- Essential blepharospasm.\r\nCongenital Entropion:\r\nTrue congenital entropion is rare.\r\nIt may be caused by:-\r\n- Improper development of retractor aponeurosis insertion into the inferior border of the tarsal plate.\r\n- Paucity of tissue may be present vertically in the posterior lamella of the eyelid.\r\n- Tarsal kink syndrome produced by structural defects in the tarsal plate.\r\n- Facial paralysis in children (unlike facial paralysis in adults which lead to ectropion).\r\nMechanism of entropion:\r\nLower lid is stabilised by orbicularis oculi muscle, tarsus, lower lid retractors and canthal tendons.\r\n- Horizontal lid stability: Horizontal lid stability is provided by canthal tendons and tarsal plate. Loosening of horizontal tension leads to lid margin rotation.\r\n- Vertical lid stability: Lower lid retractors provide vertical stability. Involutional entropion causes increased distance between lower lid retractors and inferior border of tarsal plate. Loosening of these vertical stabilising structure leads to inward lid rotation.\r\n- Overriding of preseptal orbicularis oculi muscle: Lower lid retractors have fine extensions to orbicularis oculi muscle and to the overlying skin. Preseptal part overrides the pretarsal part of orbicularis oculi muscle due to weakness or dehiscence of the connections.This rotates eyelid margin against the globe.\r\n- Orbital fat: Decrease in orbital fat content due to ageing or trauma causes enophthalmos, which increases space between eyelid and the eyeball. This produces lower lid laxity and greater orbicularis override."

                "Diagnosis depends upon elucidation of causative factors and clinical examination.\r\nExamination may show features like:-\r\n- Facial spasm, signs of skin irritation or infection.\r\n- Pseudotrichiasis.\r\n- Examination of lid margin structures may show madarosis.\r\n- Conjunctival examination may show dry eye features due to keratinisation induced by chronic irritation, symblepharon formation or forniceal (singular- fornix, where palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva meet) shortening.\r\n- Cornea may show abrasion, scarring, thinning, neovascularisation or ulceration.\r\nInvolutional Entropion:\r\n- Patient may show horizontal laxity of medial and/or lateral canthal tendons.\r\n- Snap back test: Examiner pulls lower lid down and observes the lid returning to its original position without allowing patient to blink. Normally, lid returns back quickly without blinking, but in increased laxity, blink may be needed for its return to normal position. The examiner can also pull the lower lid anteriorly away from the globe. In involutional entropion, lid may be pulled away by 6-15mm from the globe, as compared to 2-3mm only in normal lid.\r\n- Lower lid retractor function: This is evaluated by measuring lower lid excursion in downward gaze. Lower lid retractors cause 3-4mm inferior movement of lower lid margin in downgaze. This movement is absent or decreased in lower lid weakness, dehiscence or disinsertion.\r\n- Eyelid eversion: In involutional entropion, lid can be everted easily.\r\nCicatricial entropion:\r\n- Conjunctival scar: Patients usually display scarring of conjunctiva.\r\n- Lid traction: There is resistance to traction and persistence of entropion on horizontal lid traction.\r\n- Eyelid eversion: Unlike involutional entropion, eyelid eversion is difficult.\r\nAcute spastic entropion:\r\n- In acute spastic entropion, forceful closure of eyelids may lead to overriding of preseptal over the pretarsal part of orbicularis oculi muscle.\r\nCongenital entropion:\r\n- Congenital entropion shows inward turning of entire lower eyelid and lashes.\r\n- There is absence of lower lid crease.\r\nEntropion must be differentiated from conditions like:\r\n- Trichiasis: Trichiasis is an acquired posterior misdirection of previously normal eye lashes. There is no inversion of the eyelid margin.\r\n- Congenital distichiasis: In congenital distichiasis, there is partial or complete second row of eye lashes growing out of or slightly behind the meibomian gland orifices. Eye lashes in this condition are thinner, shorter and less pigmented than normal cilia (eye lashes).\r\n- Acquired metaplastic eye lashes: Acquired metaplastic eye lashes may occur in late stages of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, trachoma and chemical burns. In this, eye lashes exit near the meibomian gland orifices and are associated with other changes such as keratinisation of the conjunctiva.\r\nCongenital epiblepharon: Congenital entropion should be distinguished from more common congenital epiblepharon. Epiblepharon shows an extra horizontal fold of skin which stretches across the lid margin. The eye lashes may be turned upward, particularly medially. These may touch the cornea but they rarely cause discomfort in the eye. Pulling down the lid differentiates these conditions. In epiblepharon, the lashes turn out and the normal position of lid margin becomes visible. In congenital entropion, the entire eyelid is pulled away from the eyeball."

                "Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is a highly contagious viral conjunctivitis caused by a group of viruses known as adenoviruses. Adenovirus serotypes 8, 19 and 37 are often associated with EKC. Family of adenoviruses contain different serotypes that can also cause pharyngoconjunctival fever, non-specific sporadic follicular conjunctivitis and chronic papillary conjunctivitis. In addition to infections of ocular (pertaining to eye) surface, adenovirus (mainly those responsible for paryngoconjunctival fever) is responsible for causing infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory system. EKC is reported worldwide and has a tendency to occur in epidemics.\r\nMore than half of cases may show symptoms, though milder, in other eye.\r\nIt is one of the most common causes of acute conjunctivitis, with clinical features such as sudden onset of acute follicular conjunctivitis, watering of eyes, chemosis (swelling of conjunctiva), redness and ipsilateral (same side) pre-auricular (in front of ear) lymphadenopathy.\r\nDevelopment of keratitis (corneal inflammation) distinguishes EKC from other forms of conjunctivitis and it usually arises after fourth day of initial onset of symptoms. Corneal involvement ranges from diffuse, fine superficial keratitis to epithelial defects to sub-epithelial infiltrates. Sub-epithelial infiltrates can persist for years, which may cause glare and reduction in visual acuity.\r\nEpidemic kerato-conjunctivitis may also develop membranous or pseudo-membranous conjunctivitis in severe cases, which may lead to scarring of conjunctiva and symblepharon (adhesion between eyelid and eyeball) formation.\r\nEKC is usually a self-limiting disease and it tends to resolve spontaneously within 1-3 weeks without leaving any significant complications. Diagnosis of the disease process is clinical and the treatment is mostly symptomatic. Antiviral and cyclosporine eye drops were tried in some patients, but there was no definite benefit of these. Mild topical steroids may be used in cases with severe membranous conjunctivitis. Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK), along with low-dose mitomycin C (MMC), may be used to remove sub-epithelial opacities."

Keratitis stains with fluorescein and rose Bengal stain. Keratitis may lead to frank corneal epithelial defect.\r\n- Focal epithelial keratitis: Focal epithelial keratitis may develop one week after the onset of symptoms and it may persist for 1-2 weeks. This is characterised by central ulceration and irregular borders with grey-white dots. These epithelial changes are related to active viral disease.\r\n- Sub-epithelial infiltrates: Sub-epithelial infiltrates beneath focal epithelial lesions may develop about 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms and may persist for weeks to years. These are immunologic in nature and may resolve spontaneously, usually without scarring. Transient mild anterior uveitis may accompany this.\r\n- Disciform keratitis: Disciform keratitis may develop rarely.\r\nUveal tissue:\r\n- Anterior uveitis: Transient mild anterior uveitis may occur rarely.\r\nLaboratory diagnosis:\r\nFollowing tests may be used for diagnosis of EKC:\r\n- Polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR assay):\r\n- Fluorescent antibody test:\r\n- Complement fixation test:\r\n- Giemsa cytology: Giemsa cytology is microscopic examination of stained conjunctival scrapings for intranuclear inclusions and lymphocytes.\r\n- Cell culture:\r\n- Enzyme immune assays:\r\n- AdenoPlus test: AdenoPlus test, an enhanced device for Rapid Pathogen Screening (RPS), is an antigen-based immunoassay. This test detects the presence of adenoviral particles and thus allows patient a speedier return to school or work when the virus is no longer detectable. Ability to confirm adenoviral infection may allow the study and use of novel therapies for the disease.\r\n\r\nPCR test is more sensitive test, and therefore, use of AdenoPlus test should be limited to diagnostically challenging patients.\r\nEKC should be differentiated from conditions such as:\r\n- Trachoma.\r\n- Adult inclusion conjunctivitis.\r\n- Herpes simplex infection.\r\n- Allergic conjunctivitis.\r\n- Acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis.\r\n- Bacterial conjunctivitis.\r\n- Viral conjunctivitis.\r\n- Complications of contact lens use."

On discontinuation, it may cause rebound (recurrence) of symptoms.\r\n- Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs): Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) may be used to reduce inflammation.\r\n- Topical antibiotic: Topical antibiotic may be used to prevent superadded bacterial infection.\r\n- Cycloplegic agents: Cycloplegic agents may be used for severe photophobia.\r\n- Mild topical corticosteroids: Mild topical corticosteroids may be used in severe membranous conjunctivitis or patients with marked reduction in vision due to late sub-epithelial opacities. While corticosteroids do assist in reducing inflammation, they do not have any significant impact on natural course of the disease. Taper this treatment slowly to avoid recurrence of corneal opacities. Any patient on topical corticosteroid should be observed for side effects such as glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure) and formation of cataract.\r\n- Topical immune-suppressants (e.g.Tacrolimus ointment): Topical immune-suppressants can inhibit autoimmune inflammatory responses. Tacrolimus is a treatment option for sub-epithelial infiltrates in EKC. Tacrolimus suppresses cellular immunity.\r\n- Ophthalmic antiseptics (e.g.Povidone-iodine): Ophthalmic antiseptics are broad-spectrum germicidal agents. Povidone-iodine has broad antibacterial and antiviral activity. Povidone iodine may be used to reduce the duration of disease.\r\n\r\nSurgical management:\r\nSurgery is extremely rare for EKC and is reserved for severe cases with cicatricial conjunctivitis or symblepharon.\r\nIf surgery is necessary, it is mainly in the form of:\r\n- Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK), along with low-dose mitomycin, may be used to remove sub-epithelial opacities.\r\n- Membrane or pseudo-membrane removal: Membrane or pseudo-membrane may be peeled off gently and a topical corticosteroid may be prescribed.\r\n- Fornix reconstruction.\r\n- Entropion repair.\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nMost cases of EKC are acute, benign and self-limiting. Infection usually resolves spontaneously within 2-3 weeks. Sub-epithelial infiltrates may last for months together and may decrease vision if visual axis is involved."

Choristomas consist of ectodermal and mesodermal tissues in varying proportion and may contain epidermal appendages, skin, sweat gland, connective tissue, muscle, tooth, fat, lacrimal gland, bone, cartilage, vascular or neurologic tissue.\r\nThere are three broad categories of dermoids depending upon the location:\r\nLimbal: Limbal dermoid straddles the limbus and is the most common type. Limbal dermoids are superficial usually, but may affect deeper structures as well.\r\nCorneal: This includes dermoid which involves superficial cornea only. This spares the limbus, descemet membrane and endothelium.\r\nAnterior segment: This group includes dermoid which involves the entire anterior segment. Dermoid replaces cornea with a dermolipoma or lipodermoid that may involve iris, ciliary body and the lens.\r\nLipodermoids consists of adipose tissue with surrounding dermis-like connective tissue. Lipodermoids are soft, yellow, movable subconjunctival masses located commonly at the limbus or outer canthus."

                "Diagnosis of dermoid depends upon the clinical presentation.\r\nDermoids are dome shaped, fleshy and may have fine superficial blood vessels. Dermoids may appear keratinised and may show hair follicles and cilia.\r\nDermoid is usually single, unilateral pink-white-grey mass, one to five mm in size. Most of the epibulbar dermoids are present at the inferior-temporal part of the limbus. Clinical picture is highly variable. These may be multiple, bilateral, minutely small or big enough to obscure the cornea.\r\nRarely, dermoids may be localised to cornea or the bulbar conjunctiva only.\r\nDermoids may show associated ocular abnormalities such as:-\r\n- Lid coloboma (full-thickness defect of the lid).\r\n- Iris and choroidal coloboma.\r\n- Aniridia (absence of iris).\r\n- Microphthalmia (small eyeball).\r\n- Duane retraction syndrome and other ocular motility disorders.\r\n- Lacrimal duct stenosis.\r\n- Staphyloma (protrusion) of cornea and sclera.\r\nAssociated systemic abnormalities may be:\r\n- Goldenhar syndrome: In Goldenhar syndrome, limbal dermoids are associated with pre-auricular appendages and auricular fistulae. Other abnormalities include hemi-facial/ craniofacial microsomia (lower half of one side of face is underdeveloped), microtia (pinna or external ear is poorly developed) and vertebral anomalies (such as fused cervical vertebrae, hemi-vertebrae, spina bifida, lumbosacral anomalies and occipitalisation of first cervical Atlas vertebra). Epibulbar dermoid straddles the limbus in the infero-temporal quadrant. It is bilateral in about 25% of cases. A subconjunctival lipodermoid may be present in supero-temporal quadrant in about 50% of cases. This lipodermoid may blend with epibulbar dermoid.\r\nFacial malformations include macrostomia (unusually wide mouth), micrognathia (small jaw), dental abnormalities and facial asymmetry.\r\nThere may be associated systemic abnormalities involving cardiovascular, renal, genitourinary and gastrointestinal systems.\r\n- SCALP syndrome: Acronym SCALP includes rare clinical findings such as Naevus Sebaceous (benign neoplasm occurring mainly on scalp and face), Central nervous system malformations, Aplasia cutis congenita (absence of a portion of skin in a localised or widespread area at birth), Limbal dermoid and Pigmented naevus.\r\n\r\nEpibulbar dermoids should be differentiated from:\r\n- Foreign body granuloma.\r\n- Staphyloma.\r\n- Haemangioma.\r\n- Sclerocornea.\r\n- Corneal scar due to trauma or infection.\r\n- Atypical pterygium (wing like triangular sheet on bulbar conjunctiva).\r\nImaging studies:\r\n- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): MRI may be useful in distinguishing lesions extending into conjunctival fornix or lateral canthus (junction between lower and upper eyelid) and entangling with orbital fat and extra-ocular muscles.\r\nHistological findings:\r\nEpibulbar dermoids have choristomatous tissue which includes epidermal appendages, adipose tissue, lacrimal gland tissue, smooth and striated muscle, nervous tissue, tooth, bone and cartilage. It may also have lymphoid nodules and vascular elements. The surface of dermoids consists of corneal or conjunctival epithelium."

                "Epidemic dropsy is an acute non-infectious disease resulting from use of edible oils adulterated with Argemone mexicana (mexican poppy) seed oils. It occurs as an epidemic (unusual occurrence of disease above what is normally expected in that population in that area) form in places where mustard oil is commonly used as cooking mediums as in North, North-Western and North- Eastern states of India, generally sparing South Indian states where the predominant cooking oil is coconut oil. In Western Rajasthan, India a small outbreak was reported from consumption of contaminated sesame seeds oil with Argemone Mexicana. \r\nEpidemic dropsy was first reported by Lyon in 1877 from Calcutta, India and since then outbreaks/cases were reported from West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Maharashtra, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, Rajasthan and Punjab.\r\nThe epidemic in1998 at New Delhi was the large outbreak in which over 60 persons lost their lives and more than 3000 victims were hospitalized. Even after that the epidemics occurred at Gwalior (2000), Kannauj (2002) and Lucknow (2005), Panchmahal and Dungarpur (2012) districts of India. Usually, epidemics in India have been reported between July and September, but because of enforcement of law and public awareness the mode of presentation has changed from an epidemic to a sporadic pattern.\r\nThe main symptom of epidemic dropsy consists of bilateral swelling of legs often associated with erythema, diarrhea, dyspnoea, glaucoma. Persons of all ages and both sexes were affected except breastfed infants and small children who have no mustard oil in their diets.\r\nEpidemic dropsy has been also reported from Fiji Islands, Madagascar, Mauritius and Cape Districts of South Africa. All outbreaks were related to the intake of mustard oil contaminated with argemone oil except in the South African epidemic which occurred because of consumption of wheat flour adulterated with argemone seeds.\r\nThe Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) under Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has made \u201cThe Food Safety and Standards (packaging and labelling) regulations\u201d 2011*, according to this every container of refined vegetable oil should carry the label \u201cfree from Argemone Oil\u201d along with other specifications mentioned under FSSAI."

                "Epidemic dropsy is a clinical state caused by consuming the edible oil adulterated with Argemone mexicana seed oil that is a native plant of the West Indies, and grows wild in India. It has prickly leaves and bright yellow flowers. In India it is popularly known as Satyanashi.\r\nSeeds of Argemone mexicana are black in colour and closely resemble mustard seeds. Crops of mustard oil are matured during March and at the same time seeds of argemone also mature hence there may be accidental mixing of both seeds. However intentional mixing of Argemone mexicana oil with mustard oil by unscrupulous traders can lead to large scale outbreaks.\r\nToxic effects of argemone oil are because of two physiologically active (benzophenanthridine) alkaloids-sanguinarine and dihydro-sanguinarine. Sanguinarine interferes with the oxidation of pyruvic acid that accumulates in the blood.\r\nThe outbreaks of epidemic dropsy occur usually in months of May to September in India because newly extracted oil is sold during these months in the market. Massage with contaminated mustard oil has also been reported to cause epidemic dropsy."

                "The diagnosis of epidemic dropsy may be considered during an outbreak of bilateral tender pitting leg oedema in more than one member of a family or community. It should be distinguished from hypoproteinaemic states, filariasis, venous insufficiency, Beriberi, hypothyroidism and nephrotic syndrome. Presence of sanguinarine in blood and urine confirms the diagnosis for epidemic dropsy.\r\n\r\nBlood examination: may show anaemia and pancytopenia, raised plasma pyruvate levels and presence of sanguinarine.\r\nLiver function tests: are usually normal.\r\nKidney function tests: blood urea and creatinine may be raised if renal failure is present. Hypoalbuminaemia, raised alpha-2 globulin and reversal of albumin: globulin ratio may be found in some cases.\r\nUrinalysis: is usually normal but sanguinarine may be present.\r\nChest X-ray: may show cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema or pneumonia.\r\nElectrocardiogram: may show nonspecific ST segment, and T-wave changes or atrial or ventricular extrasystoles.\r\n\r\nDetection of argemone seed with mustard seed:\r\n\r\nAdulteration of light-yellow mustard seeds (Brassica dompestris) by argemone seeds can be visually detected. However, argemone seeds are more similar in colour to the dark mustard seeds (Brassica nigra), and are thus less easily detected. Magnifying lens can be used for identification.\r\nThe specific gravity of argemone seeds is 1.03 compared to 1.3 for mustard seeds. Hence, in normal saline solution, the mustard oil seeds settle at the bottom while argemone seeds remain suspended.\r\nMustard seeds have smooth surface. The argemone seeds have grainy and rough surface and can be separated out by close examination. When mustard seed is pressed inside it is yellow while for argemone seeds it is white.\r\n\r\nDetection of argemone oil adulteration in edible oils:\r\n\r\nNitric acid test: Nitric acid is added to the sample of oil in a test tube. The test tube is shaken and development of yellow, orange-yellow or crimson colour shows the presence of argemone oil. The test is positive only when the concentration of argemone oil is &gt;0.25%.\r\nPaper chromatographic method: It is the most sensitive method; can detect argemone oil up to 0.0001% in edible oil."

The severity of epiblepharon symptoms may be associated with the type and number of eyelashes irritating the eyes. Few and fine eyelashes are often less symptomatic than thick and plentiful lashes. Due to this variability, symptoms of epiblepharon may change with age. Child may develop decreased visual acuity due to development of induced astigmatism.\r\nClassification\r\nKhwarg and Lee (1997) proposed a grading scale for severity of lower eyelid epiblepharon based on height of the skin-fold, area of corneal touch by cilia, and area of corneal erosion.\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis\r\nEpiblepharon may be differentiated from\r\n\r\nCongenital entropion: It is characterised by an in-turning of the eyelid margin. Congenital entropion does not improve over the time and surgical correction is usually required.\r\nTrichiasis: Trichiasisis an acquired condition characterised by posterior misdirection of previously normal eye lashes. The misdirected lashes may be diffuse involving the entire lid (diffuse trichiasis) or may involve a small segment of it (simple trichiasis).\r\nDistichiasis: Distichiasis is characterised by an extra row of eyelashes emanating from the meibomian gland orifices. Like epiblepharon, eyelid margin is in its normal position.\r\nEpicanthus: Epicanthus may result similar appearing fold of skin close to the eyelid margin. An associated semicircular epicanthal fold may contribute to additional medial canthal tension and worsens epiblepharon.\r\nCongenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction: If epiphora persists after treatment of epiblepharon, congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction should be considered.\r\nAllergic conjunctivitis: Allergic conjunctivitis may also be considered in cases of chronic bilateral eye irritation, watering, and redness of eyes."

The epicanthal fold obscures the view of the medial canthus including caruncle and plica semilunaris. This is the most common congenital lid condition. Epicanthus may be an isolated phenomenon or it may be an associated feature in patients with congenital ptosis (drooping of eyelids), Down\u2019s syndrome or blepharophimosis (shortening of palpebral fissure both horizontally and vertically) syndrome. This condition may be unilateral or bilateral and is most prominent along the upper lid. Although, it is a normal finding in people of Asian ancestry, but is abnormal in non-Asians.\r\nEpicanthus gives rise to the appearance of pseudostrabismus (present as pseudoesotropia). This condition does not pose any problem to the eye. However, it produces parental concern because of its resemblance to pseudoesotropia. Gentle stretch of the soft tissues of the nasal bridge reduces appearance of epicanthus at the medial canthus and reveals normal alignment of the eyes. Cover and cross-cover test reveals orthophoria (normal alignment of eyes).\r\nDepending on the origin and configuration of free fold, there are at least four distinct types of epicanthus such as\r\n\r\nEpicanthus supraciliaris.\r\nEpicanthus palpebralis.\r\nEpicanthus tarsalis.\r\nEpicanthus inversus.\r\n\r\nEpicanthus generally disappears by the age of puberty as the nasal bridge grows. Epicanthus inversus is usually seen in association with blepharophimosis and may be associated with relative shortage of skin in lateral periorbital area.\r\nEpiblepharon, a related condition seen more frequently in Asians, occurs when a skin fold runs the entire length of the lower eyelid just below the eyelashes, causing them to turn inward, leading to irritation of eyes."

Pseudostrabismus resolves as well along with this.\r\nSurgical therapy requires correction of abnormal skin fold resulting from mal-distribution of skin within medial canthus, hypertrophy or kinking of the orbicularis oculi muscle fibers within the medial canthus (orbital portion lying over the medial canthal tendon rather than nasal to it), and possibly, an abnormal attachment of the medial horn of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle aponeurosis into the anterior part of medial canthal tendon.\r\nRepair should never be considered before the age of five years, to allow for spontaneous regression. One should consider the option to wait until the child reaches to the age of puberty. Asians should never be rushed into epicanthus repair until they understand the ramifications of a non-reversible procedure that reflect on their heritage. Surgery may be conducted under local or general anaesthesia depending upon the age of the patient.

This creates an adhesion between the superior tarsal border and the skin. This procedure may be used to revise level of the crease after ptosis surgery especially when the creases are asymmetric. This operation is also used as cosmetic operation to \u2018westernise\u2019 the Asian eyelids.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis\r\nMajority of children of Asian ancestry lose their folds during and after puberty.\r\nSurgical correction is successful in majority of cases of epicanthus."

                "Euryblepharon is characterised by increased vertical separation of the temporal aspect of the palpebral fissure so that the palpebral conjunctiva is not in apposition with the eye. The enlargement of palpebral fissure is accompanied by variable degree of lower eyelid ectropion. The lower eyelid ectropion is caused by vertical shortening of the lower eyelid relative to the horizontal dimensions of the opposing upper eyelid. In euryblepharon, palpebral apertures are larger than normal and it may be associated with epicanthus. Widening of palpebral fissure may give the appearance of eyelid ptosis. The eyelids are normally developed but the insertions of the canthal tendons appear to be widely or anteriorly placed. Frequently, the palpebral fissure has downward slant as well because of an inferiorly displaced attachment of the lateral canthal tendon.\r\nEuryblepharon is present at birth and there is no other associated primary ocular abnormality. In contrast, secondary enlargement of the palpebral aperture may accompany a variety of ocular abnormalities.\r\nThis condition was first described by Desmarres (1854). The average length of the lid fissures at different ages is given by Duke-Elder and Cook (1963). It increases from 18.35 mm. at birth to 29.68 mm. at 24 to 26 years of age. One half of this increase occurs in the first 4 years of life. The length is slightly less for females."

                "Ectopic pregnancy is the leading cause of maternal death in early pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancyis defined as implantation of a fertilized egg outside the uterine cavity. In a normal pregnancy, the fertilized egg moves from the fallopian tube into the uterus, where the pregnancy develops. In a small percentage of pregnancies, however, the embryo implants in extra uterine locations leading to an ectopic pregnancy. Most extra uterine pregnancies (97%) implant in the fallopian tube; another 3% of ectopic pregnancies implant in the cervix, ovary, peritoneal cavity, or in uterine scars. In ectopic pregnancy as the pregnancy continues, it can cause the tube to rupture with internal bleeding. This situation can be life threatening and needs to be treated as medical emergency.\r\nMany risk factors like pelvic inflammatory disease, intrauterine device, tubal surgeries, sexually transmitted diseases, infertility are associated with ectopic pregnancy.\r\nThe incidence of ectopic pregnancy among all pregnancies is about 0.25-2.0% worldwide* and can occur in any sexually active woman of reproductive age. Ectopic pregnancy was reported in 0.91% of pregnant women (with no maternal deaths) in a study done at tertiary care centre in South India.**\r\nGlobally the incidence of ectopic pregnancy has been on the rise over the past few decades because of increased incidence of salpingitis (infection of fallopian tubes mostly due to sexually transmitted infections), induction of ovulation, and tubal surgeries; and improved ability to detect ectopic pregnancy. The incidence of ectopic pregnancy has risen from 4.5 cases per 1,000 pregnancies in 1970 to 19.7 cases per 1,000 pregnancies in 1992 in North America. Though the cases of ectopic pregnancy are on rise; the incidence of rupture of ectopic pregnancy and maternal deaths has declined because of early diagnosis and management. Ectopic pregnancy still accounts for 4% to 10% of pregnancy-related deaths and leads to a high incidence of ectopic site gestations in subsequent pregnancies. Ectopic pregnancy accounts for 3.5-7.1% of maternal deaths in India.**\r\nSuspicion of an ectopic pregnancy in women of reproductive age group presenting with lower abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding with timely case management can prevent the maternal deaths and future fertility problems in women."

It may occur on only one side.\r\n\r\n(These symptoms are neither sensitive nor specific and are also associated with other pregnancy complications, such as miscarriage).\r\nOther less common symptoms include:\r\n\r\nShoulder pain can be felt because of collection of blood from ruptured tube into the abdomen under the diaphragm. Pain may be worse during lying down.\r\nWomen may feel weakness, dizziness, or fainting because of blood loss; if the fallopian tube ruptures and causes internal bleeding.\r\nIn rare instances, collapse may be the first sign of an ectopic pregnancy.

                "The diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is not always easy; and a delay in diagnosis and treatment can have serious consequences. Early diagnosis can be made before appearance of sign and symptoms.\r\nThe possibility of ectopic pregnancy should be excluded in women of child bearing age, even in the absence of risk factors (such as previous ectopic pregnancy, PID), because about a third of women with an ectopic pregnancy have no known risk factors. Clinical suspicion is the key to identifying women who need prompt and careful evaluation.\r\nThe symptoms and signs of ectopic pregnancy can resemble the common symptoms and signs of other conditions such as gastrointestinal conditions or urinary tract infection.\r\nA detailed history, clinical examination and various tests help in diagnosing ectopic pregnancy. \r\n(a) History- A proper history and physical examination are the initial steps for initiating an appropriate work-up that will result in the accurate and timely diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy.\r\n\r\nAbdominal pain with spotting, usually occurring six to eight weeks after the last normal menstrual period is the common symptoms of tubal pregnancy in symptomatic patients. Other presentations depend on the location of the ectopic pregnancy.\r\nLess commonly ectopic pregnancy presents with pain radiating to the shoulder, vaginal bleeding, syncope and/ or signs of hypovolemic shock.\r\nFindings such as hypotension and marked abdominal tenderness with guarding and rebound tenderness suggest a leaking or ruptured ectopic pregnancy.\r\n\r\n(b)Speculum and bimanual examination have a limited diagnostic value and findings may be nonspecific. Findings include:\r\n\r\nSlightly enlarged and soft uterus (enlargement of the uterus is less than expected for apregnancy duration)\r\nPresence of uterine or cervical motion tenderness\r\nAn adnexal mass may be palpated on one side\r\nUterine contents may be present in the vagina, due to shedding of endometrial lining stimulated by an ectopic pregnancy\r\n\r\n(c) Pregnancy test- A urine pregnancy test is positive in ectopic pregnancy.\r\n(d)Ultrasonography-It is the most important tool for diagnosing an extrauterine pregnancy.\r\n\r\nTransvaginal ultrasonography, or endovaginal ultrasonography, can be used to visualize an intrauterine pregnancy by 24 days post ovulation or 38 days after the last menstrual period (about 1 week earlier than transabdominal ultrasonography).\r\nVisualization of an intrauterine sac, with or without fetal cardiac activity, is often adequate to exclude ectopic pregnancy.\r\nOn endovaginal ultrasonographic scan, absence of an intrauterine pregnancy (or an empty uterus) with a serum \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotrophin (b-hCG) greater than discriminatory cut-off value may be an ectopic pregnancy or a recent abortion.\r\nUltrasound is also an essential tool in the diagnosis of non-tubal ectopic pregnancies.\r\n\r\nColor-flow Doppler Ultrasonography may be helpful in cases in which a gestational sac is doubtful or absent.\r\n(e)Test to detect serum \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotrophin (b-hCG) - b-hCG is predictable during the early weeks of a normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP). This is usually checked every 48 hours because, with a pregnancy in the uterus, the hormone level rises by 63% every 48 hours (known as the \u2018doubling time\u2019) whereas, with ectopic pregnancies, the levels are usually lower and rise more slowly or stay the same. b-hCG level less than 1,500 mIU/mL is predictive for ectopic pregnancy.\r\nThe b-hCG level is more useful in distinguishing abnormal from normal pregnancies than it is for distinguishing ectopic from intrauterine pregnancies.\r\n(f) Laparoscopy-It is indicated for patients who are hemodynamically unstable with multiple signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy.\r\nThe combination of sensitive urinary pregnancy tests, transvaginal ultrasound and serum hCG estimations enables the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy."

The drug stops the further development of the pregnancy and it is gradually reabsorbed by the body leaving the fallopian tube intact.\r\n\r\nSuccess rates of medical treatment vary (65-95%) depending on the circumstances in which methotrexate is given.\r\nFollow up visits for few weeks are required to ensure the pregnancy has completely ended.\r\nA reliable contraception should be used for at least 3 months.\r\n\r\n(c) Surgery- Surgical management is performing an operation to remove the ectopic pregnancy and it is the most established form of treatment. Surgery may also be performed if expectant management or medical management has failed.\r\nAn ectopic pregnancy can be removed from the fallopian tube by using two types of surgical procedures called salpingostomy and salpingectomy. These procedures can be performed by either Laparoscopy or Laparotomy.\r\n\r\nLaparoscopy (keyhole surgery) -An advantage of laparoscopic surgery is that the operation is less invasive, thus recovery time is quicker and less painful as compared to a laparotomy.\r\nLaparotomy (open surgery) is usually done when there is heavy internal bleeding/rupture or presence of previous scar tissue and in an emergency situation.\r\n\r\nSalpingostomy- If rupture has not occurred; the products of conception are removed through a small length wise incision in the fallopian tube (linear salpingostomy). There is a very small risk that some of the products of pregnancy may remain in the tube after salpingostomy. Therefore patient is advised to have weekly blood tests to monitor hCG levels and decreased levels of hCG shows that the pregnancy is fully resolved.\r\nSalpingectomy- If the tube has already ruptured or damaged as a result of an ectopic pregnancy, salpingectomy is performed to remove the damaged fallopian tube. In this procedure a segment of fallopian tube is removed. The remaining healthy fallopian tube may be reconnected. Salpingectomy is appropriate for women who have a healthy contralateral tube.\r\nTotal salpingectomy is done in a patient who has completed childbearing and no longer desires fertility.\r\nTissue removed at the time of surgery can be sent for testing in the laboratory if facilities are there.\r\nFuture fertility-\r\n\r\nThe chances of having a successful pregnancy in the future are good. If only one fallopian tube is present, chances of conceiving are only slightly reduced.\r\nWomen who have had a previous ectopic pregnancy are at higher risk of reoccurrence.\r\nSalpingostomy and salpingectomy have the same effect on future fertility of the women when one healthy fallopian tube is present.\r\nSalpingostomy may be preferred; if other tube is damaged. This may improve the chances ofgetting pregnantin the future.\r\nLaparoscopy and medical therapy have now emerged as the widely used therapeutic procedures with great success in terms of reduced morbidity, shorter hospital stay and conservation of fertility.\r\n\r\nRh (rhesus) factor-\r\nAll pregnant women (including ectopic pregnancies) who are Rh-negative (determined by a blood test) should receive Rh immunoglobulin (antibodies directed against the Rh)."

                "Exposure keratopathy refers to that surface disorder of the eye in which absence of an adequate tear film results in breakdown of the corneal epithelium. This may produce disruption of corneal epithelium, ulcer formation, superadded infection, thinning and even perforation of eyes in severe cases.\r\nExposure keratopathy is broadly divided into two main categories viz.\r\n\r\nExposure due to primary or secondary corneal anaesthesia or hypoaesthesia: Corneal sensation plays an important role in the maintenance of healthy corneal epithelium. It is presumed that nerve growth factors released by corneal nerves mediate epithelial cell proliferation. Thus, corneal anaesthesia results in a surface which is more vulnerable to injury, delayed healing of corneal epithelium, and progressive keratopathy. Reduced corneal sensation may be congenital or acquired, and may be complete or partial.\r\nExposure produced by mechanical eyelid abnormalities such as lagophthalmos: Lagophthalmos is the inability to close eyelids completely. Lagophthalmos may be divided into three main groups e.g. Proptosis causing excessive ocular surface exposure, palpebral (eyelid) insufficiency secondary to physiologic, congenital or acquired conditions, and idiopathic lagophthalmos. Lagophthalmos with or without exposure keratopathy may be present at night in some healthy individuals (nocturnal lagophthalmos).\r\n\r\n\r\nExposure of cornea from any cause may lead to thickening, xerosis (dryness), and scarring of epidermis."

                "Early pregnancy loss is non-induced embryonic or fetal death or passage of products of conception before 20 weeks gestation. Early pregnancy loss is also termed as spontaneous abortion or miscarriage. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines it as expulsion or extraction of an embryo or fetus weighing 500 g or less.\r\nSpontaneous abortion in the first trimester is common, affecting at least 15\u201320% of the clinically recognized pregnancies. Approximately 80% of all cases of pregnancy loss occur within the first three months of pregnancy (first trimester).\r\nAccording to March of Dimes, nearly 50% of all pregnancies end in spontaneous abortion most often before a woman misses a menstrual period or even knows she is pregnant.\r\nThe different stages of spontaneous abortion may include:\r\n\r\nThreatened abortion (pregnancy may continue): There is vaginal bleeding without cervical dilation and abortion may or may not occur.\r\nInevitable abortion: It is a condition in which vaginal bleeding is profuse, cervix has dilated. Pregnancy will not continue and will proceed to incomplete/complete abortion.\r\nIncomplete abortion: Products of conception are partially expelled.\r\nComplete abortion: Products of conception are completely expelled.\r\n\r\nSeptic abortion is defined as abortion complicated by infection. Sepsis may result from infection if organisms rise from the lower genital tract following either spontaneous or unsafe abortion. Sepsis is more likely to occur if there are retained products of conception and evacuation has been delayed.\r\nRecurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) is defined as three or more consecutive pregnancy losses before 20\u2013 22 weeks of gestation. The causes of RSA can be often related to factors associated with implantation, genetics, autoimmunity, endocrine abnormalities, infection, and anatomic uterine defects.\r\nMissed abortion: In missed abortion there is pregnancy loss after the development of embryo or fetus; but it is retained within the uterine cavity. There may be brownish vaginal discharge or spotting. \r\nAnembryonic gestation is pregnancy in which a gestational sac develops without development of any embryonic structures; previously referred to as an \u201cempty sac\u201d or \u201cblighted ovum.\r\nInduced abortion is defined as a process by which pregnancy is terminated before fetal viability.\r\nUnsafe abortion is defined as a procedure performed either by persons lacking necessary skills or in an environment lacking minimal medical standards, or both."

Follow-up of the cases includes confirmation of complete expulsion by ultrasound examination, or serial serum \u03b2-hCG measurement used in settings where ultrasonography is unavailable.\r\nSurgical management- Forinevitable, incomplete, or missed abortions, treatment is uterine evacuation. Evacuation usually involves suction curettage in less than12 weeks pregnancy and dilatation and evacuation at 12 to 23 weeks of pregnancy.

They should be given emotional support and, in the case of spontaneous abortions, reassured that their actions were not the cause.\r\nSome women may want to become pregnant soon after having an abortion. They should be encouraged to delay the next pregnancy until they have completely recovered.\r\nAbortion care should always include comprehensive contraceptive counselling with initiation of the method of choice as soon as desired after the abortion.\r\nRh-immunoglobulin:Women who are Rh negative and unsensitized should receive 50 micrograms of Rh (D)- immunoglobulin immediately after surgical management of early pregnancy loss or within 72 hours of the diagnosis of early pregnancy loss with planned medical management or expectant management in the first trimester. It is reasonable to use the more readily available 300-microgram dose if the 50-microgram dose is unavailable."

                "Eclampsia is the onset of fits (convulsions) in a woman whose pregnancy is usually complicated by pre-eclampsia. The fits may occur in pregnancy after 20 weeks gestation, in labour, or during the first 48 hours of the postpartum period. Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are part of the same disorder with eclampsia being the severe form of the disease.\r\nPre-eclampsia almost always precedes eclampsia. However, not all cases follow an orderly progression from mild to severe disease and some women develop severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia very suddenly. Most cases of eclampsia present in the third trimester of pregnancy, with about 80% of eclamptic seizures occurring intrapartum (during labour) or within the first 48 hours following delivery.\r\nAmong the hypertensive disorders, preeclampsia and eclampsia have the greatest impact on maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. Nearly one-tenth of maternal deaths in Asia and Africa and one-quarter of maternal deaths in Latin America are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Eclampsia accounts for 12% of all maternal deaths in developing countries.\r\nEclampsia is also an important etiological factor for maternal/perinatal morbidity and mortality in India. In a study from a large population-based nationally representative sample of women in India, out of 4925 live births during the study period, there were 158 women with eclampsia, giving an incidence of 3.2 %. *\r\nMajority of deaths related to pre-eclampsia and eclampsia could be avoided by timely and effective antenatal care and hospital delivery."

Plasma volume reduction due to capillary leakage and redistribution and shift of the extracellular volume from the intravascular to the interstitial compartments\r\n3. Platelet aggregation triggered by endothelial dysfunction which leads to intravascular thrombosis.\r\nThese three factors cause reduced perfusion of the brain, liver, kidneys, and the utero-placental complex and causing organ failure that endangers the lives of mother and fetus.\r\nEffects on the mother:\r\nThese include:\r\n\r\nRespiratory problems (asphyxia, aspiration of vomit, pulmonary oedema, broncho-pneumonia)\r\nHepatic disease (liver necrosis)\r\nRenal complications (acute kidney failure)\r\nVisual disturbances (temporary blindness due to oedema of the retina)\r\nEffects on the brain (haemorrhage, thrombosis, oedema)\r\nCardiac problems (heart failure)\r\nHELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count)\r\nCoagulopathy (clotting/coagulation failure)\r\nInjuries during convulsions (fractures). The main causes of maternal death in eclampsia are intracerebral haemorrhage, pulmonary complications, kidney failure, liver failure and failure of more than one organ (e.g. heart + liver + kidney).\r\n\r\nEffects on the fetus:\r\nPre-eclampsia is associated with a reduction in maternal placental blood flow which results in:\r\n\r\nHypoxia which may cause brain damage if severe or prolonged, and can result in physical or mental disability.\r\nIntrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)\r\nIn severe cases the baby may be stillborn.\r\n\r\n\r\nRisk factors-\r\nThe risk of eclampsia is more common in:\r\n\r\nprimigravidae (especially young teenagers and women over 35 years)\r\nobese women\r\nwomen with essential or renal hypertension\r\nmultiple pregnancy\r\nwomen with \u2013 diabetes, hydatidiform mole, polyhydramnios, hydrops fetalis.\r\n\r\nCommunity risk factors These include:\r\n\r\nLack of awareness about symptoms of severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia and the importance of early and regular antenatal care\r\nTransportation problems\r\nFinancial hardship and inability to pay for transport and medical care\r\nLow socioeconomic status\r\nCommunity distrust of health care personnel\r\n\r\nHealth service risk factors These include:\r\n\r\nFailure to monitor blood pressure and urine during antenatal care\r\nFailure to counsel women and families about dangerous symptoms of severe pre-eclampsia and the importance of regular antenatal care\r\nDelay in referral of women with symptoms and signs of severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia\r\nLack of a clear-cut management strategy/clinical protocols for dealing with pre-eclampsia and eclampsia\r\nLack of proper equipment and drugs to treat eclampsia\r\nInadequately trained staff to treat women with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia"

Controlling the blood pressure.\r\n4. General care and monitoring, including controlling fluid balance.\r\n5. Delivering the baby.\r\n6. Monitoring carefully to prevent further fits and identify complications.\r\n1. Making sure the airways are clear, and the woman can breathe:\r\n\r\nPlace the woman on her left side to reduce the risk of aspiration of secretions, vomit and blood\r\nGive oxygen (if available) and continue for five minutes after each fit, or longer if cyanosis persists\r\nAfter a convulsion, aspirate the mouth and throat as necessary to clear the airway\r\nStay with the woman and ensure that her airway is clear.\r\n\r\n2.Controlling fits:\r\nFits are controlled by giving the woman anticonvulsant drugs. Magnesium sulfate is used for both the prevention and treatment of eclampsia.\r\nMagnesium sulfate is the anticonvulsant of choice for women with severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. If possible, give a full regimen of magnesium sulfate to women with eclampsia or severe pre-eclampsia. If the administration of a full regimen is not possible, these women should be given the loading dose of magnesium sulfate and should be immediately transferred to a higher-level health care facility for further treatment.\r\nIf magnesium sulphate is not available, diazepam may be given, but there is a greater risk of neonatal depression because diazepam crosses the placenta freely. A single dose of diazepam is unlikely to cause much neonatal depression but, if treatment continues with this drug, the risk of neonatal depression increases and the effect may last for several days.\r\n3.Controlling blood pressure:\r\nAntihypertensive drugs should be given if the diastolic blood pressure is 110mmHg or more. The aim is to keep the diastolic blood pressure between 90\u2013100mmHg to prevent cerebral haemorrhage. A smooth and sustained reduction in blood pressure over a three\u2013hour period is preferred to a sudden drop.\r\n4.General management and monitoring, including controlling of fluid balance:\r\nThe woman is nursed in a quiet, single room and must never be left alone, because she could fit at any time and inhale secretions or vomit and/or sustain serious injuries if there is no one in the room to gently restrain her.\r\nOnly essential care should be given such as turning the woman two\u2013hourly, mouth care, (no oral fluids are given), insert a urinary catheter and monitor the urinary output and proper fluid balance.\r\n5.Delivering the baby:\r\nDelivery should take place as soon as the woman\u2019s condition has stabilized, regardless of gestational age. In cases of eclampsia, delivery should occur within 12 hours of the onset of convulsions.\r\nMedical professional may decide the method of delivery by taking into account the. gestational age, fetal and cervical status and urgency.\r\n6.Monitoring carefully to prevent further fits and identify complications:\r\nFits can also recur after delivery or can occur for the first time after delivery, within the first 48 hours. Therefore, the woman must be very carefully observed for at least 48 hours after delivery.\r\nAnticonvulsive therapy should be maintained for 24 hours after delivery or the last convulsion, whichever occurs last.\r\nAntihypertensive therapy should be continued until the diastolic blood pressure decreases to less than 110mmHg. Urinary output should be monitored.\r\nFour\u2013hourly blood pressure checking should be continued for a few days."

A bone fracture can be the result due to high force impact or stress, or trivial injury as a result of certain medical conditions that weaken the bones, such as osteoporosis, bone cancer, or osteogenesis imperfecta, where the fracture is then properly termed a pathologic fracture.\r\nClassification:\r\nBy Cause:\r\n\r\nTraumatic fracture - This is a fracture due to trauma. e.g.- Fractures caused by a fall, road traffic accident, fight and many others\r\nPathological fracture - A fracture of bone due to certain disease that has made bone weak is called pathological fracture. e.g.- a fracture through a bone weakened by metastasis. Osteoporosis is the most common cause of pathological fracture.\r\n\r\nAll fractures can be broadly described as:\r\n\r\nClosed (simple) fractures: Are those in which the skin is intact\r\nOpen (compound) fractures: Involve wounds that communicate with the fracture, and may thus expose bone to contamination. Open injuries carry a higher risk of infection.\r\n\r\nOther types of fracture are:\r\n\r\nComplete fracture: A fracture in which bone fragments separate completely.\r\nIncomplete fracture: A fracture in which the bone fragments are still partially joined. In such cases, there is a crack in the osseous tissue that does not completely traverse the width of the bone.\r\nLinear fracture: A fracture that is parallel to the bone's long axis.\r\nTransverse fracture: A fracture that is at a right angle to the bone's long axis.\r\nOblique fracture: A fracture that is diagonal to a bone's long axis.\r\nSpiral fracture: A fracture where at least one part of the bone has been twisted.\r\nComminuted fracture: A fracture in which the bone has broken into several pieces.\r\nImpacted fracture: A fracture caused when bone fragments are driven into each other.\r\nAvulsion fracture: A fracture where a fragment of bone is separated from the main mass."

                "Medicines that are used to treat heavy periods are:\r\n\r\nTranexamic acid is prescribed for 3-4 times a day. It works by reducing the breakdown of blood clots in the womb.\r\nAnti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen and mefenamic acid. These also help to ease period pain. They are taken for a few days at the time of period. They work by reducing the high level of a chemical (prostaglandin) in the lining of the uterus . Prostaglandin seems to contribute to heavy and painful periods.\r\n\r\nMedication to shrink the fibroids:Women are given a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue. This is a hormonal medicine that leads to low level of estrogen in body. Fibroids shrink if the level of estrogen falls. However, a low estrogen level can cause symptoms similar to the menopause (hot flushes, etc). These medications may also increase the risk ofosteoporosis. Therefore this treatment is given for a maximum period of six months. GnRH analogues, such as goserelin (eg Zoladex\u00ae) or leuprorelin acetate (eg Prostap\u00ae SR), are often prescribed for three to four months before having an operation, which will make it easier to remove fibroids. Sometimes a low dose of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is also given to reduce the incidence of menopausal side-effects.\r\nA new medication treatment undergoing trials:A medicine called ulipristal acetate (UPA) has shown promise in preliminary research trials. This is currently used as an emergency contraceptive. It works by blocking the effects of the hormone progestogen. Progestogen is thought to play a role in fibroid development and so it was thought that this medicine may help to shrink fibroids. A small research trial has concluded that it does seem to have an effect on shrinking fibroids, with side-effects not being too troublesome. Further larger clinical trials are needed to establish whether this is indeed a good treatment option.\r\nSurgery and other operative treatments:There are several different operations available to remove and treat fibroids.\r\nHysterectomy: This is the traditional and most common treatment for fibroids. Hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus.\r\nMyomectomy: This is a possible alternative, especially in women who may wish to have children in the future. In this operation, the fibroids are removed and the uterus is left. This procedure is not always possible.\r\nEndometrial ablation: This procedure involves removing the lining of the womb. This can be done by different methods for example, using laser energy, a heated wire loop or by microwave heating. This method is usually recommended for fibroids close to the inner lining of the uterus \r\nNHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any treatment purpose you should consult your physician."

These parasites penetrate the skin either their own or through the opening created by mosquito bites to reach the lymphatic system.\r\nThe disease is caused by the nematode worm, either Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi and is transmitted by mosquito species Culex quinquefasciatus and Mansonia annulifera/M.uniformis respectively.\r\nThe disease generally presents with the symptoms like swelling of legs, and hydrocele and can cause a raft of societal stigma.\r\nLymphatic Filariasis (LF)is commonly known as elephantiasis. It is a disfiguring and disabling disease, which is generally aquired in childhood. In the early stages,though there are either no symptoms or non-specific symptoms, the lymphatic system is damaged. This stage can last for several years. Infected persons sustain the transmission of the disease. The long term physical consequences are painful swollen limbs (lymphoedemaor elephantiasis).

Frostbite can occur when skin is exposed to a temperature of 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) or lower, resulting in vasoconstriction. The resultant decrease in blood flow does not deliver sufficient heat to the tissue to prevent the formation of ice crystals.

The role of the glomus body is to shunt blood away from the skin surface when exposed to cold temperature, thus preventing heat loss, and on the other hand, it allows maximum heat flow to the skin in warm weather, to allow heat dissipation. The glomus body has a high sympathetic tone and its potentiation leads to near complete vasoconstriction). There are four degrees of frostbite. Each of these degrees has varying degrees of pain.\r\nFirst degree: It is known as frost nip. It only affects the surface of skin, which is exposed. On the onset, there is itching and pain, and then the skin develops white, red, and yellow patches and becomes numb. The area affected by frost nip usually does not become permanently damaged as only the skin's top layers are affected.\r\nSecond degree: If skin is exposed to cold for longer duration, then it may freeze and harden, but the deep tissues are generally not affected and remain soft and normal. Second-degree injury causes blister formation after about one or two days of exposure. The blisters may become hard and blackened, but usually appear worse than they are. Most of the injuries heal in about one month, but the area may become permanently insensitive to both heat and cold.\r\nThird and fourth degrees: If the exposed area freezes further, deep frostbite occurs. The muscles, tendons, blood vessels, and nerves all freeze. The skin becomes hard, feels waxy, and the area is lost temporarily, and may be permanent in severe cases. The deep frostbite results in areas of purplish blisters which turn black and which are generally blood-filled. Nerve damage in the area can result in loss of sensations. This extreme frostbite in fingers and toes, may require amputation, if the area becomes infected with gangrene. If the frostbite has not treated, it may fall off. The extent of damage done to the area by freezing process of frostbite may take several months to assess, and this often delays surgery to remove the dead tissue."

                "Filamentary keratitis is a chronic disorder in which filaments, which are adherent complexes of mucus and corneal epithelium, are present on the corneal surface. Filaments consist of a variable combination of degenerated epithelial cells and mucous which are attached to the corneal surface at one end. Filaments present as small, gelatinous strands on the anterior surface of the cornea and may vary in size, shape, composition, and distribution.\r\nLeber in 1882, first described the characteristic threads adherent to anterior surface of the cornea (Leber. Klin Monatsbl f Augenh; 1882. P. 165). Beetham in 1935, published an extensive review and potential therapy options. He outlined that the formation of filaments is due to lacrimal gland destruction and is produced by various systemic reasons viz. infection, lymphoma or hormone dysfunction (Beetham W. Filamentary Keratitis. Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc. 1935; 33: 413-435).\r\nA lack of tear production may result in the increased production of mucous by conjunctival goblet cells. Aqueous-deficient eye is characterised by excessive abnormal debris and mucous strands, which adhere firmly to the damaged areas of corneal epithelium and basement membrane, forming corneal filaments. There may be grey sub-epithelial granular opacity, beneath the attachment to the corneal epithelium. Once established, corneal filaments are firmly attached to the underlying corneal epithelium. Friction between corneal filaments and the upper lid results in pain, epithelial tears and inflammation which leads to further filament formation.\r\nPatients affected with filamentary keratitis are often highly symptomatic and may have persistent foreign body sensation, redness and sensitivity to light, which may vary from moderate to severe in intensity.\r\nFilamentary keratitis can be a functionally debilitating and sight threatening feature of a number of ocular and systemic conditions such as:\r\n\r\nKeratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome): Both autoimmune (Sj\u00f6gren syndrome) and non-autoimmune forms of aqueous-deficient dry eye conditions may have corneal filaments. This is the commonest cause of filamentary keratitis. Sj\u00f6gren syndrome may be primary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome when these changes occur in isolation, or secondary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome when associated with connective tissue/ other diseases viz. systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis, juvenile chronic arthritis, Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis or primary biliary cirrhosis.\r\nSuperior limbic keratoconjunctivitis: Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis is the second most common disease associated with corneal filaments.\r\nExposure keratitis.\r\nCorneal oedema. \r\nCorneal surgery e.g. corneal refractive surgery.\r\nPost-cataract surgery.\r\nUse of contact lenses.\r\nAdenoviral keratitis.\r\nHerpes simplex keratitis.\r\nBacterial keratitis.\r\nNeurotrophic keratopathy.\r\nExtended eyelid closure secondary to medications.\r\nExtended patching of eyes.\r\nAcne rosacea\r\nSystemic use of diuretics.\r\nSystemic use of antihistamines.\r\n\r\nNo associated disease is found in few cases."

                "Filamentary keratitis is associated with a number of conditions or diseases associated with the ocular surface.\r\nAetiology of filamentary keratitis is related to:\r\n\r\nAn alteration in the components of the tear film and /or \r\nAbnormalities of the corneal surface.\r\n\r\nCommon risk factors include:\r\n\r\nAqueous tear deficiency: Aqueous tear deficiency as in keratoconjunctivitis sicca.\r\nSystemic diseases having effects on the corneal surface: Systemic diseases (e.g. Sj\u00f6gren syndrome) having effects on the corneal surface.\r\nCorneal exposure: Corneal exposure as in seventh cranial nerve palsy.\r\nOcular surgery: Ocular surgery (e.g. keratoplasty, cataract surgery).\r\nAnti-cholinergic medicines: Use of anti-cholinergic medicines for long periods.\r\nPtosis (drooping) of upper eyelids: Ptosis (drooping) of upper eyelids may lead to poor tear distribution and reduction in oxygenation of the corneal epithelium.\r\n\r\nThe filaments are gelatinous and refractile in appearance and can vary from 0.5mm sessile adhesions to 10mm long strings. Filaments are generally attached to the basement membrane of the corneal epithelium at one end, with the other end freely moveable. Filamentary keratitis is associated with underlying basement membrane abnormalities, most of which are related to hypertonic tear film states. Filaments elongate and coil with movement of the eyelids.\r\nThe ratio of mucous to aqueous is usually increased because of:\r\n\r\nA decrease in aqueous tear production or\r\nIncreased mucous production or\r\nAbnormal mucous accumulation.\r\n\r\nA relative deficiency in the aqueous component of tear film is usually present in cases of filamentary keratitis, which produces a relative increase in the mucinous component.\r\nAbnormalities of the ocular surface result in defects in the corneal epithelium that allow for anchoring of filaments.\r\nFilamentary keratitis and dry eye: \r\nDry eye is the disorder most frequently associated with filamentary keratitis. There is increase in tear film osmolarity due to reduced aqueous tear secretion or increased tear film stasis, which leads to increase in mucous to aqueous ratio. This imbalance of mucous to tear ratio leads to sloughing of epithelial cells and produces epithelial defects. Mucous serves as a disposal system for exfoliated epithelial cells. Increase in viscosity of mucous enhances its adherence to irregularities on corneal epithelium, thus, potential for filament formation."

                "Diagnosis of filamentary keratitis is based on the clinical history and slit lamp examination (bio-microscopy), being conducted by an eye specialist.\r\nSigns on slit lamp examination:\r\n\r\nCorneal filaments (mucoepithelioid strands): There may be multiple small, grey, mucoid filamentary attachments, firmly adherent to the corneal surface. Blinking causes painful traction on the filaments and may even detach them, leaving behind an epithelial corneal defect. Filaments may be stained best with rose bengal dye, but may be seen with fluorescein sodium and lissamine green stain as well.\r\n\r\nLocation of the filament may help determine the underlying cause,\r\nFilaments in dry eye syndrome and exposure keratopathy: Filaments in dry eye syndrome and exposure keratopathy are usually found in the interpalpebral space.\r\nFilaments due to ptosis, prolonged lid closure or superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis: Filaments due to ptosis, prolonged lid closure or superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis are seen superiorly on cornea.\r\nFilaments due to ocular surgery: Filaments due to ocular surgery are found at the site of wound or surgical trauma.\r\nFor example, filaments following corneal transplantation are seen near sutures at the graft-host junction. After cataract surgery, they may be overlying or alongside the corneal incision. Surgery-specific factors, such as the disruption of proper tear flow, pooling, toxicity from medications, and local trauma, may predispose to filament formation.\r\n\r\nDecreased aqueous tears: There may be decrease in aqueous tears with abnormal tear break-up time (BUT).\r\nIncreased mucinous element: Increased mucinous element in the pre-corneal tear film\r\nSuperficial punctate keratopathy.\r\nSub epithelial opacities: Sub epithelial opacities at the base of filaments.\r\nEpithelial defects: Frank corneal epithelial defects.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistopathology:\r\nTraditionally, it is said that the filament is composed of mucous and degenerated epithelial cells, and is adherent to the corneal epithelium at the base.\r\nWright used histochemical stains to suggest that filaments form when mucous in the tear film attaches to receptors on the corneal surface. Subsequent proliferation of a filament occurs as mucous accumulates cellular and other degenerative material. (Wright P. Filamentary keratitis. Trans Ophthalmol Soc UK 1975; 95: 260-266).\r\nZaidman et al. used electron microscopy to report that scattered groups of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts are present below the basement membrane of the corneal epithelium where filaments are attached (Zaidman GW, Geeraets R, Paylor RR, et al. The histopathology of filamentary keratitis. Arch Ophthalmol 1985; 103:1178-1181). It is suggested that an underlying pathological process damages the basement epithelium, leading to focal areas of its detachment from Bowman\u2019s layer. This raised-epithelium subsequently becomes a nidus for mucous and degenerated cells.\r\nTanioka et al. proposed that corneal epithelium cells form the core of the filament and an admixture of multiple surface mucins, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) material, and degenerated conjunctival epithelial cells become wound around the core to produce a braided shape (Tanioka H, Yokoi N, Komuro A, et al. Investigationof the corneal filament in filamentary keratitis. Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 2009; 50: 3696-3702).\r\nImpression cytology of the conjunctiva may show squamous metaplasia and reduced goblet cell with inflammatory cell infiltrates (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2922815)."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nDiagnosis of filamentary keratitis may be fairly easy but its management and resolution may be challenging.\r\nAny underlying disease such as dry eye disease or blepharitis is treated first, to improve the ocular surface initially. The underlying causes of filament formation, such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, toxic keratoconjunctivitis, contact lens over wear, or ptosis should initially be identified and treated.\r\nBecause of the multi-factorial aetiology of filamentary keratitis, treatment of this disease can be frustrating for both the patient and the treating physician.\r\nMedical therapy:\r\nFilamentary keratitis may be an acute or chronic condition. Some acute conditions resolve spontaneously, but more often than not, treatment is prolonged and chronic. Treatment should be given to keep the disease from progressing and to protect the corneal epithelium from additional insult due to dryness or trauma. Topical medications require their judicial use, since the cornea is more susceptible to the intrinsic and preservative toxicities of the drugs.\r\n\r\nTopical artificial tears: The first line of treatment is administration of topical artificial tears during the day and ointment or higher viscosity tears at bedtime. Preferably, non-preserved tear substitutes are used. Low viscosity tears may improve the tear film osmolarity, but more viscous tear substitutes can also provide substantial relief from microscopic corneal abrasions. Different tear substitutes are tried and individualised according to the benefit obtained in a particular patient. Many different tear preparations are available, and any of these may be beneficial in a given patient.\r\nTopical sodium chloride: Topical sodium chloride improves corneal epithelium by reducing oedema and obviates focal detachment in some patients.\r\nN-acetylcysteine: N-acetylcysteine is a mucolytic agent which decreases the viscosity of mucous in the pre-corneal tear film. The ocular solution is not commercially available and must be formulated without preservatives from the respiratory preparation.\r\nBandage contact lens: A bandage contact lens is often successful in cases of filamentary keratitis that do not respond to ocular lubrication. The contact lens prevents the rubbing of corneal epithelium and eyelids and may help to eliminate or reduce reactive ptosis that often occurs and exacerbates the condition. High oxygen permeability soft contact lenses may be used for better tolerance. Patients should be closely monitored because of the inherent risks of contact lens wear (e.g. infective keratitis) in dry eye patients with compromised ocular surface.\r\nTopical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroid (e.g. methylprednisolone) may reduce inflammation in filamentary keratitis. A satisfactory control of symptoms and filaments may be obtained with only short bursts of therapy in most cases. Corticosteroids are reserved for acute exacerbations since they can lead to complications like raised intraocular pressure or cataract formation.\r\nTopical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce inflammation/ symptoms and accelerate resolution of disease. The toxicity of NSAIDs on the damaged epithelium in a dry eye patient should be weighed against benefits of therapy.\r\n\r\nAssociated meibomian gland dysfunction may require measures like lid hygiene, warm compresses, topical azithromycin, oral tetracycline derivatives and omega-3 fatty acids.\r\nTopical cyclosporine may be considered in treatment of dry eye.\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\n\r\nDebridement of filaments: Debridement of filaments may be done under topical anaesthesia on slit lamp. Care should be taken to remove the entire filament without damaging the corneal epithelium at the base of the filament. Post-operative topical antibiotic for several days, a pressure patch with lubricating ointment or a bandage contact lens may be prescribed to minimise discomfort.\r\nOcclusion of punctum: Punctal occlusion may increase the aqueous tear component in some cases. Temporary punctal plugs should be utilised before permanent punctal occlusion, because in many cases, temporary improvement in tear film volume can resolve filamentary keratitis. This may obviate the need for permanent punctal occlusion. Any associated meibomian gland dysfunction is treated to minimise retention of mucous in the tear film from punctal occlusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nPrognosis of filamentary keratitis is generally good and it depends upon the effectiveness in managing the predisposing condition. At times, chronic management of this condition requires patience in both the patient and the treating physician."

                "Fluorosis is a crippling disease resulted from deposition of fluorides in the hard and soft tissues of body. It is a public health problem caused by excess intake of fluoride through drinking water/food products/industrial pollutants over a long period. Ingestion of excess fluoride, most commonly in drinking-water affects the teeth and bones.\r\nIt results in major health disorders like dental fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis and non-skeletal fluorosis. People exposed to large amounts of fluoride show dental effects much earlier than the skeletal effects. Dental fluorosis affects children and discolours and disfigures the teeth. Skeletal fluorosis affects the bones and major joints of the body like neck, back bone, shoulder, hip and knee joints resulting in to severe pain, rigidity or stiffness in joints. Severe forms of skeletal fluorosis results in marked disability. Non-skeletal forms of fluorosis are earlier manifestations, which develop long before the onset of typical changes in teeth and skeletal bones these are seen as gastro-intestinal symptoms and may overlap with other diseases leading to misdiagnosis. It affects men, women and children of all age groups.\r\nFluorosis is worldwide in distribution and endemic at least in 25 countries. It has been reported from fluoride belts: one that stretches from Syria through Jordan, Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Sudan and Kenya, and another that stretches from Turkey through Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, India, northern Thailand and China. There are similar belts in the Americas and Japan.\r\nHigh levels of Fluoride were reported in 230 districts of 20 States of India (after bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh in 2014). The population at risk as per population in habitations with high fluoride is 11.7 million as on 1.4.2014*. Rajasthan, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh are worst affected states. Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra are moderately affected states while Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Assam are mildly affected states.\r\nIn India fluorosis is mainly due to excessive fluoride in water except in parts of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh where industrial fluorosis is also seen. The desirable limit of fluoride as per Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is 1ppm (parts per million or 1 mg per litre).\r\nThe late stages of skeletal and dental fluorosis are permanent and irreversible in nature and are detrimental to the health of an individual and the community, which in turn has adverse effects on growth, development &amp; economy of the country.\r\nThe Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission started by Ministry of Rural Development worked for control of fluorosis through its awareness campaign from 1987- 1993, (coordinated by Fluorosis Control Cell at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi) had a limited coverage.\r\nIn 2008-09, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India launched a National Programme for Prevention and Control of Fluorosis (NPPCF) with the aim for prevention, diagnosis and management of fluorosis in endemic areas."

The severity and duration, (which is often episodic), depend on a person\u2019s age, nutritional status, environment, kidney function, amount of fluoride ingested, genetic background, tendency to allergies, and other factors such as hardness of the water due to presence of calcium and magnesium.\r\nVarious symptoms are:\r\n\r\nDental fluorosis: Clinical dental fluorosis is evident by staining and pitting of the teeth. In more severe cases all the enamel may be damaged (however, fluoride may not be the only cause of dental enamel defects; enamel opacities similar to dental fluorosis are associated with other conditions, such as vitamins A and D deficiency or a low protein-energy diet). Ingestion of fluoride after six years of age will not cause dental fluorosis. The teeth could be chalky white and may have white, yellow, brown or black spots or streaks on the enamel surface. Discolouration is away from the gums and bilaterally symmetrical.\r\nSkeletal fluorosis: The early symptoms of skeletal fluorosis, include stiffness and pain in the joints. In severe cases, the bone structure may change and ligaments may calcify, with resulting impairment of muscles and pain. Constriction of vertebral canal and intervertebral foramen exerts pressure on nerves, blood vessels leading to paralysis and pain.\r\n\r\nNon skeletal fluorosis/ Effects of fluorosis on soft tissues /systems:\r\n\r\nGastrointestinal symptoms: Abdominal pain, excessive saliva, nausea and vomiting are seen after acute high-level exposure to fluoride.\r\nNeurological manifestation: Nervousness and depression, tingling sensation in fingers and toes, excessive thirst and tendency to urinate\r\nMuscular manifestations: Muscle weakness &amp; stiffness, pain in the muscle and loss of muscle power, inability to carry out normal routine activities.\r\nAllergic manifestation: Skin rashes, Perivascular inflammation: pinkish red or bluish red spot, round or oval shape on the skin that fade and clear up within 7-10 days.\r\nEffects on foetus: Fluoride can also damage a foetus, if the mother consumes water/food with high concentrations of fluoride during pregnancy/breast feeding. Abortions, still births and children with birth defects are common in endemic areas.\r\nLow haemoglobin levels: Fluoride accumulates on the erythrocyte (red blood cells) membrane, which in turn looses calcium content. The membrane which is deficient in calcium content is pliable and is thrown into folds. The shape of erythrocytes is changed. Such RBCs are called echinocytes, and found in circulation. The echinocytes undergo phagocytosis (eaten-up by macrophages) and are eliminated from circulation. This would lead to low haemoglobin levels in patients chronically ill due to fluoride toxicity.\r\nUrinary tract manifestations Urine may be much less in volume; yellow-red in colour and itching in the region may occur.\r\nLigaments and blood vessel calcification: A unique feature of the disease is soft tissues like ligaments, blood vessels tend to harden and calcify and the blood vessels may be blocked.\r\n\r\nMost of these manifestations are, no doubt, nonspecific, but their occurrence in subjects living in fluorosis-endemic areas should alert suspicion. These early warning signs have been extremely helpful in early detection of large numbers of cases in rural areas; prompt intervention programmes (i.e. providing safe drinking water) in these cases have provided considerable relief within a short span of time"

                "Fluorosis is caused by excessive intake of fluorides from multiple sources such as in food, water, air (due to gaseous industrial waste), and excessive use of toothpaste. However, drinking water is the most significant source.\r\nModerate-level chronic exposure (above 1.5 mg/litre of water - the WHO guideline value for fluoride in water) is more common. Acute high-level exposure to fluoride is rare and usually due to accidental contamination of drinking-water or due to fires or explosions.\r\nFluoride in water is mostly of geological origin. Water with high levels of fluoride content are mostly found at the foot of high mountains and in areas where geological deposits are collected in sea. The drinking water fluoride so far detected in the country ranges from 0.2 to 48 mg/ litre. The desirable limit of fluoride as per Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is 1ppm.\r\nOther risk factors-\r\n\r\nSeveral of the ready to serve foods, beverages, snacks have high content of black rock salt (CaF2) or \u2018kala namak\u2019 (which has 157ppm fluoride) and red rock salts.\r\nTobacco or supari (aracanut) when they are chewed.\r\nIntake of certain drugs such as fluoroquinolone antibiotics, few anti-depressants, some anti-fungal drugs, cholesterol-lowering drugs, steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs, arthritis drugs, antacids, drugs for osteoporosis and otosclerosis. andnumerous other drugs that contain fluoridecan contribute to fluoride toxicity over time.\r\nPerson with calcium deficiency or malnourished individuals appear to be more prone to develop dental and skeletal fluorosis.\r\nFluoridated toothpastes: Indian studies have also shown that absorption of fluoride takes place within minutes after brushing the teeth with fluoridated toothpaste; the saliva from the oral cavity when analyzed for fluoride has also revealed high fluoride content.\r\nFluoridated beverages.\r\nFluoride-rich foods such as tea, ocean fish, gelatin, skin of chicken, fluoridated salt, food contaminated with post-harvest fumigants (e.g. sulfuryl fluoride) and pesticides (e.g. sodium aluminium fluoride, Na3AlF6, which may be used on grapes).\r\nFluoride from any other environmental sources, including cigarette smoke and industrial pollution, e.g. fluoride in dust and fumes from industries such as those manufacturing steel, aluminum, enamel, pottery, glass, bricks, phosphate fertilizer, and others involved with power, welding, water fluoridation plants, refrigeration, rust removal, oil refining, plastics, pharmaceuticals, tooth-paste, chemicals, and automobiles.\r\nDiets rich in fat have been reported to increase deposition of fluoride in bones.\r\nIt is also known that fluorosis, in its severe forms, is mostly restricted to a particular climate zone in the world -- the areas with semi-arid tropical conditions. In these areas, the consumption of drinking water is high and the population is more vulnerable to the disease as compared to their counterparts in colder areas with low consumption of water, though the fluoride content of water in both the areas may be the same.\r\nDental fluorosis can only occur if the fluoride exposure is during the first years of life while the teeth are forming.\r\nIn China, fluoride toxicity occurs with: brick tea and food contaminated with fluoride during drying of chilies and corn with coal briquettes.\r\n\r\nMechanism after fluoride intake: Once fluoride enters the body either through the blood vessels in the mouth or through the gastrointestinal route, it reaches the various organs and tissues in the body. Fluoride (F) being an electronegative element, having a negative charge is attracted by positively charged ions like calcium (Ca++). Bone and tooth having highest amount of calcium in the body, attract the maximum amount of fluoride and is deposited as calcium fluorapatite crystals. At the same time, from certain areas in the bone and tooth, the unbound calcium is lost."

If the symptoms are caused by fluoride, they should diminish markedly within a week and largely disappear within several weeks. Gastrointestinal symptoms settle within 15 days.\r\n(l) Physical tests for detection of skeletal fluorosis in endemic areas-\r\n(a)The subject is asked to lift a coin from the floor without bending the knee. A person with skeletal fluorosis would not be able to lift the coin without flexing the large joints of lower extremity (unable to bend without bending knee, test is present in other disease also).\r\n(b) Chin Test: The subject is asked to touch the anterior wall of the chest with the chin. If there is pain or stiffness in the neck, he/she is unable to bend the neck-touching the chest with chin is not possible.\r\n(c) Stretch Test: The individual is made to stretch the arm sideways, fold at elbow and touch the back of the head. When there is pain and stiffness, it would not be possible to touch the back of the head.\r\n(ll)Radiographs: X-ray would reveal increased girth, thickening and density of bone, ligaments calcified. Maximum ill effects of fluoride are detected in the neck, spine, knee, pelvic and shoulder joints. It also affects small joints of the hands and feet.\r\n(lll)SA/GAG test (Sialic acid / Glycosaminoglycan test) -The SA/GAG test is for early detection/diagnosIs of fluoride toxicity. The value of SA/GAG will be reduced in fluorosis and will be significantly elevated in ankylosing spondylitis. The SA/GAG value shows no significant change in arthritis, osteoporosis and spondylosis.\r\n(lV)Estimation of Fluoride content in:\r\n\r\nDrinking water- 1.0 ppm (parts per million) is considered as the permissible upper limit for fluoride content in drinking water.\r\nBlood (serum): The serum fluoride levels may or may not be informative as fluoride in circulation never maintains a steady state; it is diverted to other tissues; absorbed by tissues and excreted.\r\nUrine (24 hrs collection if possible): The urinary fluoride level is more useful compared to the blood fluoride level. If the subject has been ingesting food, water, drugs or any other substance contaminated with fluoride, urinary fluoride is bound to be high. (There is another possibility that , when an individual moves out of an endemic area and start living in a non-endemic area, there is a tendency for excreting high levels of fluoride for short duration of time (viz 1-2 months) and the subject will also have less pain in the joints and other regions. History taking is an important task in the diagnosis).\r\n\r\n(V)Haemoglobin estimation: for detection of anaemia."

                "Floppy eyelid syndrome (FES) is frequently an unrecognised cause of chronic, non-infectious unilateral or bilateral papillary conjunctivitis. It is characterised by loose floppy eyelids associated with punctate epithelial keratopathy (PEK), ptosis of lateral eyelashes and typical conjunctival changes.\r\nFloppy eyelid syndrome was described initially by Culbertson and Ostler (1981). Prior to this, it was not recognised as a specific entity. The syndrome was seen in overweight male patients with floppy, rubbery, and easily everted upper eyelids. It may be associated with a variable chronic papillary conjunctivitis of the upper palpebral conjunctiva.\r\nIt affects patients of both sexes ranging in age from two to eighty years, but it affects more commonly middle-aged obese males. The floppiness of the eyelids is due to laxity of the tarsus. Decrease in tarsal elastin contributes to the laxity of eyelids.\r\nIn addition to involvement of anterior segment, FES may also be associated with glaucoma and papilloedema due to raised intracranial pressure.\r\nA number of systemic diseases may be associated with FES, such as diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism and hypertension. These diseases may correlate better with preponderance of patients with obesity in this disorder. Obstructive sleep apnoea appears to be a particular risk, especially for obese males with FES."

It is probably induced by repeated mechanical stress, associated with eye rubbing or by sleeping habits. Patients with FES consistently sleep face down with their eyes pressed against the pillow. The disorder may be bilateral or unilateral, but there is close correlation of the eye with the side on which the patient preferentially sleeps.\r\nPoor contact of lax eyelid with the globe: Poor contact of lax eyelid with the globe in conjunction with abnormalities of meibomian glands and tear films, may contribute to the syndrome. Tear film abnormalities are characterised by lipid deficiency with consequent rapid rate of evaporation of tears.\r\nObstructive sleep apnoea (OSA): Obstructive sleep apnoea may contribute to local eyelid ischaemia which may play a role in development of FES. This ischaemia may be exacerbated by hypoventilation of OSA. These patients demonstrate partial or complete collapse of the airway during inspiration."

It should be considered in any case in which sustained trauma occurs in poorly explained or suspicious circumstances. The term factitious disorders describe conditions where physical findings are intentionally produced by person to assume sick role.\r\nFactitious disorder most commonly occurs during second or third decade of life, and more often among health professionals. Factitious disease affecting eyes is commonly seen in nasal or inferior quadrant of the eye. Topical anaesthetic abuse is one of the most common self-induced injuries to the eye.\r\nWe, as clinician, tend to find aetiology underlying any eye disease. Therefore, self-inflicted injuries often do not draw attention. Self-injuring patients often reach out for help but are incapable of describing what help is required. Failure in diagnosis of such disease may delay therapy to prevent permanent damage.\r\nFactitious disorders must be distinguished from malingering and somatoform disorders. In malingering, in addition to intentionally induced physical features, there is always evidence of external incentive. Malingering may be adaptive as in prisoners of war, and does not necessarily mean psychopathology. Somatoform disorders produce clinical findings which are not fully explained. Somatoform disorders include conditions such as hypochondriasis and hysteria."

                "Management of fibromyalgia involves a combination of medications, stress management, exercise and rest with enough sleep.There is no cure for fibromyalgia. However, symptoms can be treated with both non-drug measures and medication based treatments. Many times the best outcomes are achieved by using multiple types of treatments.\r\nNon-Drug Therapies:People with fibromyalgia can use non-drug therapies as well as medicines suggested by their doctors. Following are some non drug therapy measures to manage fibromyalgia:\r\nPatient\u2019s self-care is an important aspect to improving symptoms and daily functions of a person having fibromyalgia. Healthy lifestyle behaviour can reduce pain, increase sleep quality, lessen fatigue and help to cope better with fibromyalgia.\r\nRegular Exercise: It is reported that regular exercise is one of the most effective treatments for fibromyalgia. People with fibromyalgia who have too much pain or fatigue should begin with walking or other gentle exercise (water aerobics and/or stretching exercises) and build their endurance and intensityslowly. Patients should follow the saying, \u201cStart low, go slow.\u201d It takes time to create a comfortable routine. Just get moving, stay active and don't give up.\r\nMake time to relax each day: Deep-breathing exercises and meditation will help reduce the stress that can bring on symptoms. It\u2019s also important to manage daily schedule with time to rest and relax. Persons with fibromyalgia should avoid making too many commitments that can make them fatigue.\r\nSet a regular sleep pattern: Patient should go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. Getting enough sleep will help body to repair itself, physically and mentally. Avoid daytime napping and limit caffeine intake, which can disrupt sleep. For those who smoke, they should stop smoking (nicotine is a stimulant and aggravates sleep problems).\r\nLook forward, not backward: Person with fibromyalgia should focus on tasks need to do to get better, not what caused the illness. Do something that you find enjoyable and fulfilling every day.\r\nKeep dietary habits healthy: Person should try to eat a healthy, balanced diet. Proper nutrition can help body stay healthy and provide a constant supply of energy and nutrients so that symptoms of fibromyalgia may not get worse.\r\nEducate yourself about illness; and share the information with family, friends and co-workers.\r\nMoist heat can be used to relieve deep muscle pain and stiffness like moist heating pad, warm bath or shower.\r\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT and related treatments, such as mindfulness, can help patients learn symptom reduction skills that lessen pain. CBT is based on understanding that how thoughts and behaviours can affect pain and other symptoms. Mindfulness is a non-spiritual meditation practice that cultivates present moment awareness and has been shown to significantly improve symptoms of fibromyalgia.\r\nOther complementary and alternative therapies (sometimes called CAM or integrative medicine), such as acupuncture, chiropractic and massage therapy, yoga and tai chi can be useful to manage fibromyalgia symptoms (though many of these treatments have not been well tested in patients with fibromyalgia).\r\nManage risk factors-It is important to address risk factors and triggers for fibromyalgia including sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, and mood problems such as stress, anxiety, panic disorder, and depression. This may require involvement of other specialists such as a sleep medicine doctor, psychiatrist.\r\nDrug therapy-\r\nInitial management of fibromyalgia involves patient education with focus on non-pharmacological therapies. Though in non-responsive patients, pharmacological therapies should be added especially to those with sleep or mood disturbances.\r\nDrugs like pregabalin, gabapentin (which work by blocking the over activity of nerve cells involved in pain transmission) may be used for management of pain of fibromyalgia. These medicines may cause dizziness, sleepiness, swelling and weight gain.\r\nThe antidepressants duloxetine and milnacipran, which are used to relieve pain, fatigue, and sleep problems, are generally used at lower doses than for treatment of depression.\r\nSeveral medications are avoided or used carefully. Opioids, hypnotics, anxiolytics, and certain skeletal-muscle relaxants are used with caution because of the potential for abuse and the risk of worsening fatigue and cognitive dysfunction.\r\nOver-the-counter medicines such as acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen or naproxen are not effective for fibromyalgia pain. These drugs may be useful to treat the pain triggers of fibromyalgia such as arthritis.\r\nFor sleep problems, some of the medicines that treat pain also improve sleep. These include cyclobenzaprine, amitriptyline, gabapentin and pregabalin. Sleeping medicines like zolpidem or benzodiazepine medications are not recommended in patients with fibromyalgia.\r\nVitamin Dsupplements may reduce pain in people with fibromyalgia who are deficient in thisvitamin."

                "Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a global problem which affects girls and women worldwide. Although it is internationally recognized as a violation of human rights and legislation to prohibit the procedure has been put in place in many countries, the practice is still being reported.\r\nFemale genital mutilation (FGM) includes procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. FGM comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons1.\r\nEvery year about 3 million girls and women are at risk of FGM2. FGM can have a negative effect on several aspects of a girl\u2019s or woman\u2019s life, including her physical, mental and sexual health and her relationship with her husband or partner and other close family members.\r\nFGM is mostly carried out on young girls between infancy and age 15. More than 200 million girls and women alive today have been subjected to the practice in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia where FGM is more common3.\r\nFGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women. It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women. It is nearly always carried out on minors and is a violation of the rights of children. The practice also violates a person's rights to health, security and physical integrity, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to life when the procedure results in death.\r\nHuman Rights violated by the practice of FGM4:\r\n\r\nRight to the highest attainable standard of health\r\nRight to life and physical integrity, including freedom from violence\r\nRight to freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment\r\nRight to equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex\r\nRights of the child\r\n\r\nThe practice is mostly carried out by traditional circumcisers, who often play other central roles in communities, such as attending childbirths. In many settings, health care providers perform FGM due to the erroneous belief that the procedure is safer when medicalized. WHO strongly urges health professionals not to perform such procedures.\r\nIn 2008, the World Health Assembly passed resolution (WHA61.16) on the elimination of FGM, emphasizing the need for concerted action in all sectors - health, education, finance, justice and women's affairs. In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on the elimination of female genital mutilation3.\r\nIn 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) includes a target under Goal 5 to eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and FGM/C, by the year 2030."

                "Who is at risk?\r\nProcedures for FGM are mostly carried out on young girls sometime between infancy and adolescence, and occasionally on adult women. More than 3 million girls are estimated to be at risk for FGM annually1.\r\nThe practice is most common in the western, eastern, and north-eastern regions of Africa, in some countries the Middle East and Asia, as well as among migrants from these areas. FGM is therefore a global concern2.\r\nCultural and social factors for performing FGM:\r\nFGM is carried out for various cultural, religious and social reasons within families and communities in the mistaken belief that it will benefit the girl in some way such as- a rite of passage into womanhood, to preserve a girl\u2019s virginity until marriage. Following are some reasons:\r\nRespect for tradition: Community members, including the women see it as a sign of respect towards the elder members of the community.\r\nRite of passage: In many cultures, FGM constitutes an important rite of passage into adulthood for girls. It may be considered a necessary step towards being viewed as a respectable adult woman.\r\nSocial convention: Those who adhere to the practice may be better accepted in their communities, while those who do not may face condemnation, harassment and exclusion.\r\nEnhance fertility: In some practicing communities, women and men believe that if a woman is not cut she will not be able to become pregnant or she may face difficulties during labour.\r\nMarriageability: There is often an expectation that men will marry only women who have undergone FGM. The desire and pressure to be married, and the economic and social security that may come with marriage, can perpetuate the practice in some settings.\r\nEnsure virginity, chastity and faithfulness: FGM is believed to safeguard a girl\u2019s or woman\u2019s virginity prior to marriage and ensure fidelity after marriage.\r\nCleanliness and beauty: In some communities, FGM is performed in order to make girls \u201cclean\u201d and beautiful. Cleanliness may refer to the body, but it may also refer to spiritual purity.\r\nFemininity: The removal of genital parts that are considered masculine (i.e. the clitoris) is considered to make girls more feminine, respectable and beautiful.\r\nReligion: Some communities believe that FGM is a religious requirement, and some religious leaders may promote the practice, even though it is not mentioned in any major religious texts3,4.\r\nMedicalization of FGM:\r\nMedicalization of FGM refers to situations in which FGM is practised by any category of health-care provider, whether in a public or a private clinic, at home or elsewhere. It also includes the procedure of re-infibulation at any time in a woman\u2019s life.\r\n(Re-infibulation: The procedure to narrow the vaginal opening in a woman after she has been deinfibulated (such as after childbirth); also known as re-suturing2.\r\nTypes of FGM\r\nFemale genital mutilation is classified into 4 major types:\r\n\r\nType 1:Often referred to asclitoridectomy, this is the partial or total removal of the clitoris (a small, sensitive and erectile part of the female genitals), and in very rare cases, only the prepuce (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoris).\r\nType 2:Often referred to asexcision, this is the partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora (the inner folds of the vulva), with or without excision of the labia majora (the outer folds of skin of the vulva).\r\nType 3 (infibulation):Often referred to as infibulation. This is the narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora, sometimes through stitching, with or without removal of the clitoris (clitoridectomy).\r\nType 4:This includes all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, e.g. pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterizing the genital area2."

As girls and women living with FGM often do not seek care for such type of symptoms until the symptoms are advanced or cannot be hidden.\r\nOnce it has been established that the girl or woman has undergone any type of FGM, this information and the subsequent clinical examination should be done with proper care.

                "Gangrene is a condition that arises when a considerable mass of body tissue dies (necrosis) . This may occur after an injury or infection, or in people suffering from any chronic health problem affecting blood circulation. Gangrene is primarily caused due to reduced blood supply to the affected tissues that leads to cell death. Diseases like diabetes and long-term smoking increases the risk of gangrene. It can affect any part of the body but typically starts in the toes, feet, fingers and hands (the extremities).\r\nTypes of gangrene:\r\nDry gangrene: Dry gangrene begins at the distal part of the limb due to ischemia (restricted supply of blood), and often appears in the toes and feet of elderly patients due to arteriosclerosis and thus, it is also known as senile gangrene. Dry gangrene is generally seen due to arterial occlusion. As there is limited putrefaction and bacteria fail to survive, dry gangrene spreads slowly until it reaches the point where the blood supply is adequate to keep tissue viable. The affected part is dry, shrunken and dark reddish-black, like mummified flesh.\r\nWet gangrene: Wet gangrene occurs in moist tissues and organs such as the mouth, bowel, lungs, cervix, and vulva. Bed sores occurring on body parts such as the sacrum, buttocks, and heels are also classified as wet gangrene infections. Wet gangrene is characterized by numerous bacteria and generally has a poor prognosis (compared to dry gangrene) due to septicaemia. In wet gangrene, the tissue is infected by microorganisms like Clostridium perfringens or Bacillus fusiformis that causes the tissues to swell and emit a foetid smell. Wet gangrene usually develops rapidly due to blockage of venous (mainly) and/or arterial blood flow. The affected part is saturated with stagnant blood,that promotes rapid growth of bacteria.\r\nGas gangrene: Gas gangrene is a bacterial infection that produce gas within tissues. It is the most severe form of gangrene usually caused by Clostridium perfringens bacteria. Infection spreads rapidly as the gases produced by bacteria expand and infiltrate healthy tissues in the vicinity.Gas gangrene is generally treated as a medical emergency as it quickly spreads to the surrounding tissues."

                "Diagnosis of GERD is uaually accompanied with an accurate symptomatic history. It can be diagnosed by procedures like Endoscopy, Barium swallow and Manometry.\r\nEndoscopy: It is a procedure in which fibre-optic tube is inserted into the stomach. To confirm a diagnosis of GERD, the endoscope is inserted into mouth and down into the throat. The procedure is usually done while the patient is awake, and may be given a sedative to relax. An endoscopy is used to check whether the surface of esophagus has been damaged by stomach acid. It can also rule out more serious conditions that can also cause heartburn, such as stomach cancer.\r\nBarium swallow: If there are symptoms of dysphagia then patient may be referred for a test known as barium swallow. The barium swallow test is one of the most effective ways of assessing the swallowing ability and finding exactly where the problems are occurring. The test can often identify blockages or problems with the muscles used during swallowing.\r\nManometry: Manometry is used to assess how well lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is working by measuring pressure levels inside the sphincter muscle. During the test, patient will be asked to swallow some food and liquid to check the proper functioning of LES.\r\nNHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health.

As the optic nerve is more damaged, peripheral (side) vision is lost progressively till only the central vision is left resulting in tunnel vision (as if looking through the end of a narrow tunnel).\r\nPrimary angle closure glaucoma can present either as a chronic disease as said above or as an acute attack. The symptoms of an acute attack include sudden blurring of vision, pain in the eyes, headache, nausea, vomiting and seeing rainbow like rings around lights. \r\nSecondary glaucoma result from other predisposing conditions of the eye or body and may be asymptomatic or present with the symptoms of predisposing conditions like trauma, uveitis (inflammation of the middle layer of the eye) and so on.\r\nDevelopmental glaucoma affects children. It can present with large eyes, whitening of the cornea (front part of the eye), excessive tearing, sensitivity to light (closure of eyes on light exposure), jerky movements of the eyes and squinting of the eyes (condition in which one of the eyes turns inwards or outwards as the other eye looks forward)."

The most common abnormality of the eye leading to raised pressure of the eye is an abnormal drainage angle (angle is a structure of the eye where the fluid produced inside the eye exits). This abnormality of the angle causes obstruction to the flow of the fluid which accumulates inside the eye and causes pressure on the optic nerve leading to progressive damage and loss of vision. \r\nWho is at risk?\r\nAlthough glaucoma can affect anyone in any age group, some individuals are at higher risk than others. Common risk factors include elevated pressure of the eye, age over 40 years, individuals with a family history of glaucoma, use of steroid-containing medications (eye drops/ pills/inhalers/ skin creams), those with higher refractive error (power) of the eyes , patients with history of blunt eye injury, history of hypertension and diabetes."

                "Glaucoma management aims at maintaining the vision related quality of life of the patient throughout his/her lifetime with minimal possible medications at a sustainable cost. The treatment helps to control the disease process so that further damage to the optic nerve can be prevented. There is no cure for glaucoma and treatment cannot restore visual loss but only prevent further deterioration. In the current day practice, reduction of pressure of the eye remains the only modifiable risk factor. Hence the management of glaucoma revolves around the effective control of pressure of the eye with three modalities :\r\nMedical therapy with ocular hypotensive medications, laser therapy and glaucoma surgery.\r\nThe most important consideration in the management is that once a diagnosis of glaucoma is made, treatment and regular follow-ups are required lifelong.\r\nMedical management\r\nMedical management remains the first line of treatment in most of the glaucomas. These medications either decrease the secretion of fluid of the eye or increase its exit through the drainage angle. These agents are available as either eye drops or pills. Currently, following medicines are available to control pressure of the eye. They include- prostaglandin analogues, beta adrenergic blockers, alpha adrenergic agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, parasympathomimetic agents and hyperosmotic agents.\r\nPatients who are prescribed with these eye drops have to observe the following precautions.\r\n\r\nThe drops have to be instilled as advised by the doctor. Failure to instill drops as prescribed will lead to fluctuations in pressure of the eye and damage to the optic nerve. Probably the best way to put drops is to schedule the instillation with a daily activity like brushing teeth, breakfast or dinner. \r\nTo prevent the drops from spilling around the eye, the patient has to widely open the lids and directly look into the tip of the dropper and instill only one drop at a time.\r\nTo minimize the absorption into the bloodstream and prevent untoward side effects on the body, the eye has to be closed for one or two minutes and the eyelid pressed gently at the corner of the eyes near to nose.\r\nPatients prescribed with more than one type of eye drop at one time, have to maintain a gap of 5-10 minutes between two different drop instillation.   \r\nThe drops need to be instilled even during the time of travel or during hospital visits.\r\n\r\nLaser Therapy\r\nThe initial management of primary angle closure disease is laser iridotomy (making a small hole in the iris to bypass pupillary block) usually done with a YAG laser. Laser trabeculoplasty can be performed to lower IOP in patients with Primary open angle glaucoma.\r\nSurgical management\r\nSurgical therapy is required in patients who are intolerant to medical therapy or in whom medical therapy is considered ineffective to control pressure of the eye. Surgical therapy like the medical therapy does not improve the lost visual function, but help to prevent further damage to the optic nerve. Some cases may require continuation of eye drops after surgery for better control of pressure of the eye.\r\n\r\nFiltration surgery \u2013 this is the most commonly practiced glaucoma surgery for controlling raised pressures. This surgery aims to create a new channel for the exit of eye fluid, bypassing the usual route of drainage i.e. the angle and created subconjunctival filtration.\r\nGlaucoma drainage devices \u2013 they are used in patients with previously failed filtration surgeries and also in some patients with advanced secondary glaucomas. These procedures involve insertion of a small tube into the eye which is used to facilitate the drainage of the eye fluid from the eye.\r\nCyclodestructive procedures \u2013 in a painful blind eye , diode laser cyclophotocoagulation or cyclocryotherapy is performed to permanently reduce aqueous formation by the ciliary body and give the patient symptomatic relief."

Increased hormone production will over-stimulate the thyroid gland and causes it to enlarge.The leading cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease. Graves' disease causes immune system (the body\u2019s natural defense system) to send antibodies (proteins that fight infections) to the thyroid gland. The antibodies stimulate the thyroid gland, causing an increased amount of thyroid hormones to be released.\r\nHyporthyroidism (Underactive thyroid gland): Goitre can also develop if the thyroid gland becomes underactive (hypothyroidism). Underactive thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, the body will stimulate it to produce more. This can cause the thyroid gland to enlarge. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease causing hypothyroidism."

                "Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a rare disorder of the peripheral nervous system. The syndrome is named after the French physicians Georges Guillain and Jean Alexandre Barr\u00e9, who described it in 1916. It is also called acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP).\r\nGBS is an autoimmune disorder in which a person\u2019s own immune system attacks healthy nerve cells in peripheral nervous system. The syndrome can affect the nerves that control muscle movement and nerves that transmit feelings of pain, temperature and touch. This leads to muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling and sometimes paralysis.\r\nMost people recover fully from GBS, but some people have long-term nerve damage. 3%-5% of GBS patients may die from complications, which include paralysis of the muscles that control breathing, blood infection, lung clots or cardiac arrest.\r\nThe cause of this condition is unknown, but it\u2019s typically triggered by an infectious illness, such as the gastrointestinal infection or a lung infection. Few countries from Europe and Asia have reported familial occurrence of GBS (42 GBS patients found from 20 families). In a hospital based study from South India among 150 GBS cases reported during 10 years period, 2 cases belonged to a single familya.\r\nAccording to WHO overall incidence of GBS is 0.4 to 4.0 people per 100 000 per year. People of all ages can be affected, but it is more common in adults and in males.\r\nDuring 2015 and 2016, nine countries and territories(El Salvador, French Polynesia, Martinique, Colombia, Suriname, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Panama, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and/or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS casesb. Researchers are studying a potential link between the surge in GBS cases and Zika virus infection. Zika virus is not yet proven to be the cause of the increased GBS incidence in Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Suriname or Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)."

                "Giant (mechanically induced) Papillary Conjunctivitis (GPC), the severe form of mechanically induced papillary conjunctivitis, may be secondary to a variety of mechanical stimuli of the tarsal conjunctiva. Since GPC is predominantly associated with the use of contact lenses (CLs), the disease is also referred to as contact lens-induced papillary conjunctivitis (CLPC).\r\nGPC is an inflammatory condition seen in upper tarsal conjunctiva, initially reported by Spring in 1974 (Spring TF, Reaction to hydrophilic lenses, Med J Aust 1974; 1:449-50). A papillary reaction, similar to the one with allergic conjunctivitis, occurs in soft contact lens wearers. Allansmith and colleagues further detailed the syndrome, suggesting that it may be immunologic in origin, with the proteinaceous deposits on the contact lenses, serving as the antigen (Allansmith MR, Korb DR, Greiner JV, et. al. Giant papillary conjunctivitis in contact lens wearers. Am J Ophthalmol 1977; 83:697-708).\r\nGPC, a non-infectious inflammatory disorder was originally named for the presence of giant papillae (1.0mm or greater in diameter) along the upper tarsal surface. However, papillae measuring 0.3mm or greater are now considered abnormal and a feature of this condition.\r\nGPC is most often associated with wearing soft (hydro-gel) contact lenses, though it can occur with any type of contact lens. The contact lens type, material, wearing schedule, cleaning process and length of time lenses have been worn contribute to the severity of the disease, with soft lens wearers suffering from more severe manifestations of disease than counterparts in rigid gas-permeable (RGP) lenses. Silicone hydro-gel lenses also appear to have similar effects with prolonged use. Incidence among extended wearers is supposed to be higher than the daily wearers of soft lenses.\r\nWith an increased frequency of contact lens replacement from more than four weeks to a period less than that, the incidence of GPC reduces. Both sexes develop GPC. GPC may be more aggressive in children who wear contact lenses.\r\nThe condition has also been reported in patients with:-\r\n- Ocular dermoids.\r\n- Ocular prosthesis.\r\n- Exposed sutures/ knots following ocular procedures (such as monofilament nylon sutures).\r\n- Extruded scleral buckles.\r\n- Glaucoma filtering blebs.\r\n- Corneal surface irregularity. \r\n- Exposed corneal deposits.\r\n- Tissue adhesives.\r\n- Even elevated corneal scars.\r\n    Dry eye is a common association, especially with contact lens wearer.\r\nA related phenomenon is the so called \u2018mucus fishing syndrome\u2019, when, in a variety of underlying anterior segment disorders, patients develop or exacerbate a chronic papillary reaction due to repetitive manual removal of mucus. Giant papillae can also be seen in other conditions such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC).\r\nOne study suggests that patients who suffer from allergies seem to have more severe signs and symptoms of GPC. Significant correlation between GPC and other forms of allergy like rhinitis, hay fever and environmental allergy were found. Giant papillary conjunctivitis can follow seasonality similar to that of environmental allergies.\r\nBecause of the high prevalence of GPC in contact lens wearers, every patient who wears contact lens should be considered potential candidate for GPC."

                "The antigens responsible for giant papillary conjunctivitis are not yet identified.\r\nThe initiating event is believed to be antigenic stimulus and/or mechanical irritation of the upper palpebral (lid) conjunctiva, perhaps by a contact lens surface or edge or deposit, followed by histological changes in the tissue (mast cell de-granulation and secondary inflammatory cascade). This leads to conjunctivitis and further tissue changes and increasing inflammatory markers in the tears.\r\nDebris on the surface of contact lenses may be a cause as well as a result, leading to inflammation that causes more lens deposits to form, leading to further inflammation.\r\nPoor cleaning, thick or rough contact lens edges, heat sterilisation and extended wearing time favour the development of giant papillary conjunctivitis.\r\nFirst-generation silicone hydro-gel contact lenses may be more prone to GPC development, perhaps because of their mechanical stiffness or higher propensity for lipid deposition. Silicone hydro-gel lenses tend to induce more local GPC, whereas soft (hydro-gel) lenses tend to induce more generalised GPC reactions in upper palpebral conjunctiva.\r\nAntigenic factors:\r\nIn patients with GPC, there is increase in numbers of inflammatory cells like neutrophils, lymphocytes, mast cells, plasma cells eosinophils and basophils in conjunctival epithelium and substantia propria. These findings, along with elevation of cytokines and chemokines in the tear film of GPC patients, suggest a possible allergic mechanism for the development of disease. Locally produced tear immunoglobulin (e.g. IgE, IgG, and even IgM in severe cases) are also found to be elevated in the tears of GPC patients, with the degree of elevation correlated to the severity of symptoms. With discontinuation of lens wear and resolution of the signs and symptoms, these tear immunoglobulin levels return to normal.\r\nThe proteinaceous deposits on the lens surface have been cited as the possible nidus for the development of inflammation and thus, the papillae associated with GPC. Even with the best cleaning regimens involving enzymatic treatment, a residual coating still exists, and as new coating material is constantly built on the surface of the lens, the overall lens coating increases. The lens type and material also affect the rate and amount of accumulation of protein coating.\r\nThe nature of these deposits is similar in patients with and without GPC. However, those affected with GPC generally have more coating on their contact lenses. Immunoglobulin G, A and M (IgG, IgA and IgM) are also found in the protein deposit on GPC-associated contact lenses.\r\nMechanical hypothesis: \r\nMechanical hypothesis, is supported by the association between GPC and inert objects, such as cyanoacrylate adhesives, exposed sutures and scleral buckle elements, ocular dermoids and orbital prosthesis. It is postulated that the irritation produced by lens damages conjunctival epithelial cells, and causes release of chemotactic factors (e.g. neutrophil chemotactic factor). It is suggested that a combination of direct trauma and the resulting inflammation cascade can stimulate a hypersensitivity reaction to lens-bound antigens."

                "Diagnosis of GPC is generally made by thorough history and careful clinical observation.\r\nGPC shares morphologic and histologic similarities with VKC, but is best differentiated from this and other immunologically based conjunctival inflammation by the associated clinical history (e.g. contact lens wear, surgical intervention).\r\nA careful and selective history is necessary to elicit the reports of symptoms that many may consider normal discomfort associated with contact lens use.\r\nA history of systemic allergy also help to predict which of the contact lens users may end up with GPC.\r\nSlit-lamp (bio-microscopic) examination by an eye-specialist is required for the diagnosis.\r\nThe bio-microscopic finding of normal tarsal conjunctiva, include a vascular arcade of fine, radiating vessels running perpendicular to the lid margin and a smooth, moist and pink surface. This has been termed a \u2018satin\u2019 appearance. Generally, the surface is devoid of papillae, or there may be a fine, fairly uniform papillary appearance detectable after the instillation of fluorescein dye and examination with cobalt-blue filter. These papillae, if present, are often smaller than 0.3 mm in size. Non-specific signs of inflammation, such as thickening of the tarsal conjunctiva with mild hyperaemia, may be noted in early cases. In addition, bulbar conjunctival injection, superior corneal pannus, and corneal opacities may also be found on examination. As the disease progresses, non-uniform papillary changes develop, and finally giant papillae are seen, defined as a papillary reaction greater than 0.3 mm.\r\nAllansmith divided superior tarsal surface into three zones. Zone 1 is located proximally along the uppermost edge of tarsal plate, zone 3 is located distally adjacent to the lid margin, with zone 2 in between. Papillae associated with soft contact lens-related GPC first appear in zone 1 and progress to zone 2 and 3.This pattern is reversed in GPC related to rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lens wear. Papillae associated with RGP contact lenses are typically seen in zone 3, adjacent to the lid margin or distal half of the lid. These papillae are usually fewer in number and flattened in appearance. The topographic difference between GPC associated with large diameter soft contact lenses and small diameter RGP lenses is most probably related to mechanical or immunological stimulus for GPC. The conjunctiva is affected in sequential manner as the disease progresses. In the early stages, there is hyperaemia of the conjunctiva, with partial loss of the vascular pattern of conjunctiva. The papillae size is around 0.3mm. With progression of the disease there is more congestion of the tarsal surface with loss of vascular pattern. In severe cases, the tarsal plate is thickened with total obscuration of the vascular pattern. This stage may be associated with sub-conjunctival scarring.\r\nCharacterisation of the size and location of the papillae is helpful in correlating clinical findings with patient symptoms. Delineation of the upper tarsal plate into three zones, as well as two areas medially and laterally, can be useful to the clinician in determining whether findings are within the normal variance or whether it represents disease. For example, large papillae in the junctional or transitional zone are not considered pathologic and should be disregarded in the assessment of the upper tarsal conjunctiva.\r\nBio-microscopic findings may also be helpful, as the location and appearance of the papillae are associated with the type and material of the lens. Soft contact lens wearers often exhibit a generalised papillary response, whereas those wearing rigid gas-permeable lenses or silicone hydro-gels manifest papillae in a more localised fashion. Soft lens wearers usually form papillae nearest the upper margin of the tarsal plate and progress to diffuse involvement, whereas rigid lens wearers and those using silicone hydro-gel lenses develop papillae near the lid margin and persist in a more localised pattern.\r\nIn addition, other associated signs and symptoms can aid in the diagnosis of GPC. These signs and symptoms are often classified into four stages:\r\nStage 1, or Preclinical disease: Minimal mucous discharge is usually noted upon awakening, and patients may have occasional itching after lens removal. Examination of the lens reveals a mild protein coating. The tarsal conjunctiva may appear normal, or exhibit mild hyperaemia with normal vascular structures.\r\nStage 2, or Mild disease: There is increased mucous production along with itching, increased lens awareness and marked coating of the contact lens. Blurring of vision may occur. Mild to moderate injection of the tarsal conjunctiva is seen with some loss of normal vascular pattern (i.e. superficial vessels are typically obscured, but deeper vessels are still visible). The papillary reaction noted on examination may show variability in terms of the size of the papillae. Some of the papillae measure 0.3 mm or greater at this stage, and can best be detected upon examination with cobalt-blue filter after instillation of fluorescein dye.\r\nStage 3, or Moderate disease: Itching and mucous formation, along with lens coating, are more prominent, and patients often have difficulty with lens tolerance and keeping the lens clean. Increased lens awareness and excessive lens movement with blinking results in fluctuating vision and reduction in lens wear time. The tarsal conjunctiva shows marked thickening and injection, with obscuration of normal vascular pattern. The papillae increases in both size and number, and the papillae appear more elevated secondary to changes in the underlying tissue (e.g. sub-conjunctival fibrosis and thickening).\r\nStage 4, or severe disease: Patients are often unable to wear their lenses at all, with intense discomfort and cloudy vision upon initial insertion of the lens. There is excessive lens movement and poor centration of the contact lens. Increased mucous secretion is also seen, often to the point where the eyelids are stuck together in the morning. The normal vascular pattern is completely obscured, and the papillae have enlarged to size of 1 mm or greater. There may be sub-conjunctival scarring and fluorescein staining of the apices of papillae.\r\nIt is important to note that, although these stages can aid in the characterisation of the disease, patient presentation is often variable. Some patients may have minimal complaints but exhibit marked inflammatory changes on the tarsal conjunctiva; in contrast, patients with severe symptoms may present with only mild or early tarsal changes. Also, despite GPC is often noted bilaterally, the clinical findings may be grossly asymmetric. In some cases, the disparity between eyes is easily explained (e.g. poor lens fit), but in other cases, no specific reason is determined.\r\nThus signs of GPC are:\r\n- Increased mucous discharge. Increased mucous discharge in GPC is because of increased surface area and thickness of epithelium with a resultant increase in total number of goblet cells. There is also increased mucous secretion by non-goblet epithelial cells.\r\n- Substantial CL protein deposits may be present.\r\n- Excessive CL mobility due to upper lid capture.\r\n- Superior tarsal hyperaemia and papillae; by definition, \u2018giant\u2019 papillae are &gt; 1.0 mm in diameter, but the clinical syndrome of mechanically induced papillary conjunctivitis commonly features only fine/medium papillae, particularly in early or mild disease.\r\n- Focal apical ulceration and whitish scarring may develop on larger papillae.\r\n- Ptosis may occur, mainly as a result of irritative spasm and tissue laxity secondary to chronic inflammation.\r\nThe pathognomonic sign of disease is papillae formation on the upper tarsal conjunctiva. Presence of papillae larger than 0.3 mm in association with presence of the symptoms is diagnostic of GPC.\r\nHistological/ Immuno-histochemical studies:\r\nNeutrophils and lymphocytes are present in the epithelium and substantia propria of normal conjunctival tissue. Mast cells and plasma cells are also present, though they are sequestered to the substantia propria. In patients with GPC, these cells increase in number and are often found throughout the epithelium and the substantia propria, and are found in conjunction with other inflammatory cells, such as basophils and eosinophils. Elevation of cytokines and chemokines in the tear film of GPC patients, suggest a possible allergic mechanism for the development of disease. Locally produced tear immunoglobulin (e.g. IgE, IgG, and even IgM in severe cases) are also elevated in the tears of GPC patients.\r\nThe proteinaceous deposits on the lens surface have been cited as the possible nidus for the development of inflammation and thus, the papillae associated with GPC. The lens type and material also affect the rate and amount of accumulation of protein coating.\r\nThe nature of these deposits is similar in patients with and without GPC. Those affected with GPC generally have more coating on their contact lenses. Immunoglobulin G, A and M (IgG, IgA and IgM) are also found in the protein deposits on GPC-associated contact lenses.\r\nGPC should be differentiated from conditions such as:\r\n- Allergic conjunctivitis.\r\n- Viral conjunctivitis.\r\n- Bacterial conjunctivitis.\r\n- Chlamydial genitourinary infections.\r\n- Congenital ptosis."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nOther cause of conjunctival papillae should be excluded, as well as CL intolerance due to other causes, such as a reaction to lens cleaning solutions and dry eyes.\r\nGPC treatment is directed at reducing or eliminating any mechanical stimulation and lens coating from the contact lenses or modulating the immune response to the antigenic proteins on the lens surface. Depending on the severity of disease, several or all of the strategies for reducing lens coating or mechanical stimulation may need to be employed.\r\nThe ultimate goal in managing patients with GPC is to allow them to continue wearing their contact lenses.\r\nIndividuals utilising daily disposable lenses have not been reported to develop GPC.\r\nRemoval of the stimulus:\r\n- Measures adopted to reduce exposure to the antigenic proteins on the contact lens:\r\n\r\nCL wear should be discontinued for several weeks and the current lenses replaced. For mild-moderate disease, this may be adequate for resolution. In severe CLPC a longer interval without lens wear may be needed.\r\nDecreasing the lens wear time.\r\nChanging design of the contact lens.\r\nChanging the lens material.\r\nShortening contact lens replacement interval.\r\n\r\n- Assessment of the status and fit of an ocular prosthesis.\r\n- Replacement of ocular prosthesis by a new prosthesis (preferably coated with bio-compatible material- biocoat).\r\n- Removal of other underlying causes, such as exposed sutures or a scleral buckle.\r\n- Partial excision, revision with non-penetrating drainage surgery or glaucoma drainage device implantation for filtering bleb.\r\n- Cessation of contact lens wear, substituting spectacles or refractive surgery, may be necessary for severe or refractory disease.\r\n\r\nEnsure effective cleaning of CL or ocular prosthesis:\r\n- Changing the type of CL solution, particularly discontinuation of preservative-containing preparations. Cleaning, rinsing and storage solutions containing preservatives such as thiomersal and chlorhexidine should be discarded.\r\n- Switching to monthly, then daily disposable CL, if the condition persists after renewing non-disposable lenses.\r\n- Rigid lenses carry a lesser risk of CLPC, probably because they are easier to clean effectively.\r\n- Regular (at least weekly) use of contact lens protein removal tablets (enzyme cleaning).\r\n- Ocular prosthesis: Ocular prosthesis should be cleaned with detergent and polished.\r\n\r\nGeneral measures:\r\n-Cold compresses: Cold compresses help in improving symptoms.\r\n\r\nMedical therapy:\r\nMedications such as mast cell stabilisers and topical corticosteroids may be needed to control immune reaction.\r\nDrug therapy includes:\r\n-Topical artificial tears: Artificial tears provide lubrication and help to wash away the environmental allergens and lens debris.\r\n-Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine: Topical combined vasoconstrictor and antihistamine like antazoline (antihistamine) with xylometazoline (vasoconstrictor) may offer relief in some cases.\r\n-Topical mast cell stabilisers: Mast cell stabilisers should be non-preserved in patients wearing soft contact lens, or can be instilled when the lenses are not in the eye, with a delay of perhaps half an hour after drop instillation prior to lens insertion. Most can be continued long-term if necessary. Examples are cromolyn sodium, lodoxamide, nedocromil and pemirolast. Cromolyn sodium in early GPC, particularly when combined with meticulous lens hygiene, gives relief of foreign body sensation, dryness, congestion, mucus production and in papillary size.\r\n-Topical selective second-generation H1-blocking antihistamines: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines are much more selective, and thus significantly reduce the occurrence of adverse drug reactions, such as drowsiness/ sedative action, dry eye and dry mouth.\r\n-Selective H1-blocking antihistamines and topical mast cell stabilisers (Dual acting drugs): Agents such as azelastine, epinastine, bepotastine, olopatadine and ketotifen have both mast cell-stabilising and anti-histamine properties. These agents have a relatively rapid onset of action. Topical antihistamine and mast cell stabiliser combination solution may offer a pharmacologic adjunctive treatment. Combined antihistamine/mast cell stabilisers generally suffice without exposing the patient to the known risks of topical corticosteroids. Most patients do not require more aggressive treatment.\r\n-Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory preparations like ketorolac and diclofenac may improve symptoms. Combining one of these with a mast cell stabiliser is an effective regimen in some patients.\r\n-Topical corticosteroids: Topical steroids like fluorometholone or loteprednol may be used. Topical steroids can be used for the acute phase of resistant cases, particularly those where effective removal of the stimulus is difficult, as in bleb-related disease.\r\nShort-term low-potency topical corticosteroid used concurrently with combined antihistamine/mast cell stabiliser (dual-acting drugs) is a more effective treatment than mono-therapy with either separately.\r\nThere is no role of long-term usage of topical steroids in treatment due to associated complications (development of cataract, glaucoma or superadded infections).\r\n-Immune-modulator drugs: Immune-modulator drug such as tacrolimus ointment is found to be comparable to fluorometholone in efficacy without the side effects of corticosteroids in the treatment of GPC. (http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/22821643).\r\nTopical tacrolimus ointment for severe GPC cases, refractory to conventional therapy, appears to be effective alternative treatment (http://reference.medscape.com/medline/abstract/18216583).\r\n\r\nImmune response modulation for GPC mainly focuses on topical therapy, most commonly mast cell stabilisers and loteprednol. Mast cell stabilisers may be used in patients with moderate to severe GPC that suffered a recurrence of symptoms despite changes in the contact lens design or polymer. The use of steroids, such as loteprednol, has been found to reduce the presence of papillae, itching, and lens intolerance. However, chronic treatment with a steroid is generally not recommended in these cases.\r\nA combination of the two options seems most appropriate for initiating treatment for the patient suffering from GPC.\r\n\r\nFor stage 1, more frequent observation (e.g. 4-6 month follow-up) may be all that is required, as these individuals are generally asymptomatic but will be predisposed to developing GPC.\r\nTreatment for stage 2 to stage 3 should begin with discontinuation of contact lenses for about 2-4 weeks, with re-evaluation of the conjunctiva and refit with frequent replacement of contact lenses. These can range from daily disposables lenses to lenses that are replaced every 2 weeks. For those changing their lenses every 1-2 weeks, a lens cleaning regimen utilising a hydrogen peroxide (disinfection by hydrogen peroxide appears to be least likely to further traumatise the conjunctiva)based cleaner is preferred. If there is return of symptoms despite a change in the lens type and polymer, discontinue the lenses for another 2-4 weeks, refit with a daily disposable lens (or RGP lens) and add a mast cell stabiliser. These patients should generally be re-evaluated 3-4 times in a year.\r\nFor severe, or stage 4 disease, discontinuation of contact lens wear may be required for at least 4 weeks, along with refitting the contact lens with either a daily disposable or RGP lens. Check for the resolution of associated findings of corneal and apical papillary staining. The appearance and size of the papillae may not change during the course of treatment for severe GPC. If the associated inflammatory signs have resolved, then attempts to refit the patient with a new lens may have a greater success rate. If the patient is refitted with a daily wear contact lens and replaces the lens in an interval of 4 weeks or less, the rate of developing GPC reduces.\r\nIf there is no response and signs and symptoms persist, one may have to consider discontinuing contact lens use.\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\n-Refractive surgery: Refractive surgery such as laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) may be considered in patients who refuse conservative management. This helps in avoiding contact lenses.\r\nTherapeutic effect is evidenced by:\r\n- Return of contact lens tolerance.\r\n- Decreased mucous in tears.\r\n- Suppression of ocular itching.\r\n- Decreased hyperaemia of tarsal conjunctiva.\r\n- Decreased inflammation of giant papillae.\r\n\r\nAmelioration of symptoms is more important than clinical signs in assessment of therapeutic effect.\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nOverall prognosis of giant papillary conjunctivitis is good. About 80% of patients may return to comfortable contact lens wear with appropriate management.\r\nGiant papillary conjunctivitis has been a common cause of temporary and permanent contact lens intolerance.\r\nThe eyelids in some patients may return to their normal appearance following resolution of GPC, whereas in others, lid retain small, white-capped scars of giant papillae for long periods, sometimes indefinitely.\r\nPatients should be educated about the chronic nature of disease and its clinical symptoms (e.g. Itching of eyes, mucous discharge and contact lens intolerance). Patient should be advised to present within a week of any relapsing symptoms. Patient should understand appropriate contact lens cleaning and follow-up care."

                "Gaming disorder is recently recommended by World Health Organisation (WHO) for inclusion in the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). ICD is used by medical practitioners around the world to diagnose conditions and by researchers to categorize conditions.\r\nUse of the internet, computers, smartphones and other electronic devices has excessively increased over recent decades. While the increased use in certain fields such as real-time information exchange is associated with benefits to users, excessive use in some other fields such as gaming may result in health problems. For some countries, the gaming disorder has become a significant public health concern.\r\nWHO defines gaming disorder as a pattern of gaming behavior (\u201cdigital-gaming\u201d or \u201cvideo-gaming\u201d) characterized by impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences.\r\nFor the diagnosis of gaming disorder the behaviour pattern must be of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning and would normally have been evident for at least 12 months. However, if symptoms are severe and all requirements are met, health care professionals may include people who have been playing for shorter periods of time.\r\nThe inclusion of gaming disorder in ICD-11 means health care workers and doctors can now diagnose people with health conditions identical to those characteristic of gaming disorder in many parts of the world and accordingly countries would take into consideration this disorder when planning public health strategies for treatment and prevention.\r\nWith increasing use of cyber space by children and students in the form of playing online games, making friends, and using social networking sites, shopping etc., they are more vulnerable to cyber-crimes.\r\nKnow more about cyber threats that can impact them and ways to safeguard themselves against cyber-crimes by clicking on the following links.\r\nA Handbook for Adolescents/Students on Cyber Safety_English\r\nA Handbook for Adolescents/Students on Cyber Safety_Hindi"

                "Various factors may be responsible for gaming disorder.\r\nThere are two types of video games. One is standard video game which is designed to play by a single player. The game is completed with a mission or clear goal hence addiction in these games is related to completing that mission or beating a high score or preset standard.\r\nOther type of videogame is associated with online multiplayer games. Gamers with this type of addiction enjoy creating and temporarily becoming an online character. They often build relationships with other online players as an escape from reality. An intelligent child who is unpopular at school can become dominant in the game. The virtual life becomes more appealing than real life.\r\nVideo game addiction may be a clinical impulse disorder. Those with certain personality disorders or disabilities are at greater risks than others. Compulsive gamers enjoy to a fantasy world to escape their real life troubles and unpleasant emotions. A report indicates that 41% of those play online videogames wants to escape from reality.\r\nMany video games satisfy basic psychological needs, and players often continue to play because of rewards, freedom, and a connection to other players. It takes away from physical activity and time to be spent on studies, with friends, and even with family. Children who play four to five hours per day have no time for socializing, doing homework, or playing sports and it interferes with normal social development.\r\nSelective risk factors for gaming disorders could be-\r\nBiological factors\r\n\r\nCo-morbid disorders (psychiatric problem like depression, anxiety)\r\nVulnerability to addictions\r\n\r\nPersonality and psychological factors\r\n\r\nDeficit of social skills and extreme shyness\r\nLow self-esteem and indecision\r\nLow resilience\r\nFrustration\r\n\r\nEnvironmental factors\r\n\r\nFamily environment: conflicts, poor communication and affection, lack of supervision\r\nSchool environment with low performance\r\nPoor social environment\r\n\r\nStress factors\r\n\r\nGrief\r\nDrastic life change"

                "Hepatitis is a term used to describe inflammation (swelling) of the liver. It can be caused due to viral infection or when liver is exposed to harmful substances such as alcohol. Hepatitis may occur with limited or no symptoms, but often leads tojaundice, anorexia (poor appetite) and malaise. Hepatitis is of 2 types: acute and chronic.\r\nAcute hepatitis occurs when it lasts for less than six months andchronic if it persists for longer duration.\r\nA group of viruses known as the hepatitis viruses most commonly cause the disease, but hepatitis can also be caused by toxic substances (notably alcohol, certain medications, some industrial organic solvents and plants), other infections and autoimmune diseases.\r\nTypes of hepatitis: The most common types of hepatitis are described below:\r\nHepatitis A:Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus. It is the most common type of viral hepatitis. It is generally seen in the areas where sanitation and sewage disposal are poor. This disease is commonly spread through fecal-oral route (ingestion of contaminated food and water). It is usually a short-term (acute) infection and its symptoms pass away within three months. There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A other than using medication, such as the painkiller ibuprofen, to relieve symptoms. A vaccination can protect against hepatitis A. Vaccination is recommended if a person is travelling to countries where the virus is common, such as the Indian subcontinent, Africa, Central and South America, the Far East and Eastern Europe.\r\nHepatitis B:Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus. This can be found in blood and body fluids, such as semen and vaginal fluids, so it generally spread during unprotected sex or by sharing needles to inject drugs. Hepatitis B is commonly seen in drug users. It is common in India and other parts of the world, such as China, Central and Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Most people infected with hepatitis B are able to fight off the virus and fully recover from the infection within a couple of months. The infection can be unpleasant to live with, but usually causes no lasting harm. However, a small minority of people may develop long-term infection. This is known as chronic hepatitis B. A vaccination is available for hepatitis B, which is recommended for people in high-risk groups, such as injecting drug users.\r\nHepatitis C:Hepatitis C is caused by the hepatitis C virus. This can be found in the blood and to a much lesser extentin the saliva, semen or vaginal fluid of an infected person. It is particularly concentrated in the blood, so it is usually transmitted through blood-to-blood contact. Hepatitis C often causes no noticeable symptoms, or causes symptoms that are mistaken for the flu, therefore so many people are unaware if they are infected. Many people fight off the infection and will be free of the virus. In the remaining the virus might stay in their body for many years. This is known as chronic hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C can be treated by taking antiviral medications, although there can be some unpleasant side effects. There is currently no vaccination for hepatitis C.\r\nAlcoholic hepatitis:Drinking excessive amount of alcohol over the course of many years can damage the liver, leading to hepatitis. This type of hepatitis is known as alcoholic hepatitis. It is estimated that heavy drinkers has some degree of alcoholic hepatitis. The condition does not usually cause any symptoms and is often detected with a blood test. If a person with alcoholic hepatitis continues to drink alcohol, there is a real risk that he may develop cirrhosis and possibly liver failure.\r\nOther types of hepatitis\r\nHepatitis D:Hepatitis D, caused by the hepatitis D virus, is only present in people already infected with hepatitis B (it needs the presence of the hepatitis B virus to be able to survive in the body).\r\nHepatitis E:Hepatitis E, caused by the hepatitis E virus, is generally a mild and short-term infection. It also spreads through fecal-oral route. Person-to-person transmission is rare.\r\nAutoimmune hepatitis:Autoimmune hepatitis is a very rare cause of chronic (long-term) hepatitis. The white blood cells attack the liver, causing chronic inflammation and damage. This can lead to more serious problems, such as liver failure. The reason for this reaction is unknown. Symptoms include tiredness, pains in abdomen, joint aches, jaundice (yellow tinge to your skin and whites of eyes) and cirrhosis. Treatment for autoimmune hepatitis involves medicines that suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. Steroid medication (prednisolone) can gradually reduce swelling over several weeks, and can then be used to control symptoms."

This can be a result of having oral sex with someone who has genital herpes. The herpes simplex virus, is highly contagious and can be easily passed from person to person by close direct contact. After someone has contracted the virus, it remains dormant (inactive) for most of the time. Although the virus can be activated by certain triggers, resulting in an outbreak of cold sores. These triggers vary from person to person but can include fatigue, an injury to the affected area."

They inserted the F9 gene into an adeno-associated virus-8 vector, which has a propensity for the liver, where factor 9 is produced, and remains outside the chromosomes so as not to disrupt other genes. The transduced virus was infused intravenously. To prevent rejection, the patients were primed with steroids to suppress their immune response.\r\nImmune tolerance therapy (ITT): People with moderate to severe inhibitors are usually advised to try a treatment called immune tolerance therapy (ITT).

Patients may have associated flushing.\r\n- Patients with postganglionic Horner syndrome may have orbital pain.\r\n\r\nPharmacological testing:\r\nPharmacological testing helps in identifying an ocular sympathetic lesion. Preganglionic lesions are associated with higher incidence of malignancy.\r\n1. Cocaine test: Topical cocaine inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine from synaptic cleft and therefore acts as indirect sympathomimetic agent. Pupil dilates poorly in Horner syndrome unlike in normal eyes. Cocaine is instilled into each eye. After 40-60 minutes, an unequal size of pupil more than 0.8 mm is significant.\r\n2. Apraclonidine test: Topical apraclonidine has no effect on normal pupil but has mydriatic (which dilates pupil) effect on abnormal pupil. There is increased sensitivity to apraclonidine in Horner syndrome. However, in acute cases, negative apraclonidine test does not exclude Horner syndrome, where cocaine test is more helpful.\r\n3. Hydroxyamphetamine test: Topical hydroxyamphetamine releases norepinephrine from postganglionic neurons at iris dilator muscles (which dilates the pupil). Hydroxyamphetamine in cases of Horner syndrome with intact postganglionic fiber dilates affected pupil to an equal or greater extent as compared to normal pupil. However, pupil in Horner syndrome with damaged postganglionic fiber, do not dilate as well, as the normal pupil dilates.\r\n4. Adrenaline test: Topical adrenaline (1:1000) in preganglionic lesions, does not cause dilatation of both pupils. In postganglionic lesions, due to denervation hypersensitivity, affected pupil dilates but the normal pupil does not (with this low concentration of adrenaline).\r\n\r\nImaging studies:\r\n1. X-ray chest may be helpful in diagnosing apical bronchogenic carcinoma.\r\n2. CT scan of head may be helpful in cases of stroke.\r\n3. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain and neck may delineate carotid artery dissection."

Treatment at this level depends upon risk of coronary events, presence of diabetes or end organ damage.

Malignant hypertension refers to severe hypertension ( more than 200mm of Hg as systolic and more than 130mm of Hg as diastolic) in conjunction with bilateral retinal haemorrhages and exudates with or without papilloedema.\r\nIn hypertensive retinopathy, retinal arterioles (small diameter blood vessels joining arteries to capillaries) respond to systemic hypertension by narrowing. Narrowing depends upon the degree of pre-existent involutional sclerosis (fibrosis). Therefore, hypertensive narrowing in its pure form is seen in young individuals whereas less narrowing is seen in older individuals due to rigidity of vessels (caused by involutional sclerosis). In sustained systemic hypertension, there is vascular leakage due to disruption of blood-retinal barrier. Hypertensive retinopathy shows features of narrowing (Vasoconstriction), involutional sclerosis (arteriosclerosis) and leakage (haemorrhage, oedema and hard exudates)."

Severe hypertension may lead to obstruction of arterioles and formation of cotton-wool spots.\r\n- Leakage: Abnormal vascular permeability leads to retinal oedema, flame-shaped haemorrhages and formation of hard exudates. Hard exudates may be arranged as macular star around the fovea. There may be swelling of the optic nerve head as disc oedema in malignant hypertension.\r\n- Arteriosclerosis: There is thickening of blood vessel wall. Thickening causes marked changes at arteriovenous crossings.\r\nHypertensive retinopathy is graded as (Keith-Wagener classification):\r\n- Grade 1: It is characterised by mild generalised arteriolar narrowing and tortuosity, particularly of smaller branches, with broadening of arteriolar light reflex and concealment of vein.\r\n- Grade 2: There is more severe generalised as well as focal arteriolar narrowing. There is deflection of veins at arteriovenous crossings (Salus\u2019 sign).\r\n- Grade 3: It consists of copper-wiring of arterioles, banking of veins distal to arteriovenous crossings (Bonnet\u2019s sign), tapering of veins on both sides of arteriovenous crossings (Gunn\u2019s sign) and right angled deviation of veins. Cotton wool spots, hard exudates and flame-shaped haemorrhages may also be present.\r\n- Grade 4: Along with changes of grade 3, there may be silver-wiring of arterioles (due to further sclerosis) and disc swelling.\r\nSystemic hypertension may show other ocular manifestations such as:\r\n- Retinal artery occlusion.\r\n- Branch retinal vein occlusion.\r\n- Retinal arterial macroaneurysm.\r\n- Ischaemic choroidal infarcts (Elschnig\u2019s spots).\r\n- Ischaemic optic neuropathy.\r\nFluorescein angiography test: Acute malignant hypertension on fluorescein angiography shows non-perfusion of retinal capillaries, microaneurysms and dendritic pattern of choroidal filling in early phase.

                "Hypertension\r\nHypertension, also known as high or raised blood pressure, is a condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure. Blood is carried from the heart to all parts of the body in the vessels. Each time the heart beats, it pumps blood into the vessels. Blood pressure is created by the force of blood pushing against the walls of blood vessels (arteries) as it is pumped by the heart. The higher the pressure in blood vessels the harder the heart has to work in order to pump blood. If left uncontrolled, hypertension can lead to a heart attack, an enlargement of the heart and eventually heart failure. Blood vessels may develop bulges (aneurysms) and weak spots due to high pressure, making them more likely to clog and burst. The pressure in the blood vessels can also cause blood to leak out into the brain. This can cause a stroke. Hypertension can also lead to kidney failure, blindness, rupture of blood vessels and cognitive impairment.\r\nBlood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and is recorded as two numbers usually written one above the other. The upper number is the systolic blood pressure - the highest pressure in blood vessels when the heart contracts, or beats. The lower number is the diastolic blood pressure - the lowest pressure in blood vessels when the heart muscle relaxes. Normal adult blood pressure is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 120 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg.\r\nHypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure equal to or above 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure equal to or above 90 mm Hg.\r\nMore than 1 in 5 adults worldwide have raised blood pressure \u2013 a condition that causes around half of all deaths from stroke and heart disease. Complications from hypertension account for 9.4 million deaths worldwide every year.\r\nIn nearly all high-income countries, widespread diagnosis and treatment with low-cost medication have led to a significant drop in the proportion of people with raised blood pressure as well as the average blood pressure across populations. This has contributed to a reduction in deaths from heart disease. For example, the prevalence of raised blood pressure in the WHO region of the Americas in 2014 was 18%, as compared to 31% in 1980.\r\nIn contrast, low-income countries have the highest prevalence of raised blood pressure. In the WHO African region, more than 30% of adults in many countries are estimated to have high blood pressure. This proportion is increasing and the average blood pressure levels in this region are much higher than global averages.\r\nMany people with high blood pressure in developing countries are not aware of their disease. Those who are diagnosed may not have access to treatment and may not be able to successfully control their illness over the long term. It contributes to the burden of heart disease, stroke and kidney failure and premature mortality and disability.\r\nDetection, treatment and control of hypertension is an important health priority worldwide."

These are electronic, mercury and aneroid devices.\r\n\r\nWHO recommends the use of affordable and reliable electronic devices that have the option to select manual readings. Semi-automatic devices enable manual readings to be taken when batteries run down.\r\nIt is recommended by WHO that mercury devices should be phased out in favour of electronic devices (as mercury is a toxic material).\r\nAneroid devices such as sphygmomanometers should be used only if they are calibrated every six months and users should be trained in measuring blood pressure using such devices.\r\n\r\nBlood pressure measurements need to be recorded for several days before a diagnosis of hypertension can be made. Blood pressure is recorded twice daily, ideally in the morning and evening. Two consecutive measurements are taken, at least a minute apart and with the person seated. Measurements taken on the first day are discarded and the average value of all the remaining measurements is taken to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension.\r\nRoutine laboratory tests are also recommended before initiating therapy. These include an electrocardiogram; urine analysis; blood glucose and hematocrit; serum potassium, creatinine (or the corresponding estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR]), calcium; and a lipid profile, after 9 to12 hour fast, that includes high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides.\r\nDigital blood pressure measurement machines can be used outside clinic settings. Self-monitoring of blood pressure is recommended for the management of hypertension in patients where measurement devices are affordable and who have limited access to health services due to geographic, physical or economic reasons."

For others, these changes are insufficient and they need prescription medication to control blood pressure.\r\nLifestyle measures:\r\n\r\nSalt restriction - reducing salt intake to less than 5 g of salt per day(typical salt intake is 9 -12 g per day)\r\nLimit intake of alcohol.\r\nHigh consumption of vegetables and fruits and low-fat diet.\r\nReducing weight and maintaining it.\r\nRegular physical exercise - hypertensive patients should participate in at least 30 min of moderate-intensity dynamic aerobic exercise (walking, jogging, cycling or swimming) on 5 to 7 days a week.\r\nStop Smoking and use of other tobacco products.\r\n\r\nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-The DASH eating plan requires no special foods and instead provides daily and weekly nutritional goals. This plan recommends:\r\n\r\nEating vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.\r\nIncluding fat-free or low-fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oil\r\nLimiting foods that are high in saturated fat, such as fatty meats, full-fat dairy products, and tropical oils such as coconut, palm kernel, and palm oils.\r\nLimiting sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets.\r\n\r\nWhen following the DASH eating plan, it is important to choose foods that are:\r\n\r\nLow in saturated andtransfats\r\nRich in potassium, calcium, magnesium, fiber, and protein\r\nLower in sodium\r\n\r\nAntihypertensive Medicines- Antihypertensive drugs (drugs lowering the BP) work in several ways, such as removing excess salt and fluid from the body, slowing the heartbeat or relaxing and widening the blood vessels. Medicines to lower blood pressure include:\r\n\r\nDiuretics (Water or Fluid Pills):Flush excess sodium from the body, which reduces the amount of fluid in blood and helps to lower your blood pressure.\r\nBeta Blockers:Help heart to beat slower and with less force. As a result, heart pumps less blood through blood vessels, which can help to lower blood pressure.\r\nAngiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors: Angiotensin-II is a hormone that narrows blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. ACE converts Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors block this process, which stops the production of Angiotensin II, lowering blood pressure.\r\nAngiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs):Block angiotensin II hormone from binding with receptors in the blood vessels. When angiotensin II is blocked, the blood vessels do not constrict or narrow, which can lower your blood pressure.\r\nCalcium Channel Blockers:Keep calcium from entering the muscle cells of heart and blood vessels. This allows blood vessels to relax, which can lower blood pressure.\r\nAlpha Blockers:Reduce nerve impulses that tighten blood vessels. This allows blood to flow more freely, causing blood pressure to go down.\r\nAlpha-Beta Blockers:Reduce nerve impulses and also slow the heartbeat. As a result, blood pressure goes down.\r\nCentral Acting Agents:Act in the brain to decrease nerve signals that narrow blood vessels, which can lower blood pressure.\r\nVasodilators:Relax the muscles in blood vessel walls, which can lower blood pressure."

                "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of viruses that is common throughout the world. HPV is one of the causative agents in the sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in men and women with and without clinical lesions a. HPV is transmitted through sexual contact and is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract.\r\nThe main burden of HPV-related disease is due to cervical cancer. HPV infection is a well-established cause of cervical cancer and a relevant factor in other anogenital cancers (anus, vulva, vagina and penis) and head and neck cancers. HPV is also responsible for other diseases such as recurrent juvenile respiratory papillomatosis (a disease in which tumours grow in the air passages leading from the nose and mouth into the lungs) and genital warts in men and women. Genital warts are very common and highly infectious.\r\nCervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide and second most common cancer in women living in less developed regions. World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 530 000 new cases of cervical cancer globally (estimations for 2012), with approximately 270 000 deaths (representing 7.5% of all female cancer deaths). More than 85% of these deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries.\r\nAbout 80% of cancer cases attributable to HPV were in developing countries. The highest estimated incidence rates for cervical cancer are in sub-Saharan Africa, Melanesia, Latin America and the Caribbean, south-central Asia and south-east Asia.\r\nIndia has a population of 436.76 million women aged 15 years and older who are at risk of developing cervical cancer. Every year 122844 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 67477 die from the disease (estimations for 2012). In India cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women and also the second most common cancer among women between 15 and 44 years of ageb.\r\nBased on Indian studies (performing HPV detection tests in cervical samples) about 5.0% of women in the general population are found to carry cervical HPV-16/18 infection at a given time, and 82.7% of invasive cervical cancers showed the presence of HPVs 16 or 18.(Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the literatures by ICO HPV Information Centre)b.\r\nOther epidemiological risk factors for cervical cancer are early age at marriage, multiple sexual partners, multiple pregnancies, poor genital hygiene, malnutrition, use of oral contraceptives, and lack of awareness.\r\nIndia also has the highest (age standardized) incidence rate as 22 (per 100,000 women per year) of cervical cancer in South Asia (estimations for 2012), compared to 19.2 in Bangladesh, 13 in Sri Lanka, and 2.8 in Iran.\r\nHPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for about 70% of all cervical cancer cases worldwide. HPV vaccines that prevent against HPV 16 and 18 infections are now available and have the potential to reduce the incidence of cervical and other anogenital cancers."

                "Heat- Related Illnesses are the various manifestations of extreme heat and are increasing with increased global warming and heat waves. Periods of extreme heat that have an effect on human health are referred as heat waves. Climate change is leading to an increase in average temperatures and increased possibilities of severe heat waves. The impact of extreme summer heat on human health may be exacerbated by increase in humidity. Heat waves are an emerging public-health problem.\r\nExtreme heat can lead to minor illnesses, such as heat rash (prickly heat), heat oedema, heat cramps, and tetany, as well as serious illnesses as heat syncope, heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Heat stroke is the most severe form of the heat-related illness. The mortality rate among heat stroke victims is as high as one-third, and one-fifth of the heat stroke survivors suffer neurologic damage.\r\nHeat-related illnesses include:\r\n\r\nHeat rash (Prickly heat): small, red, papules develop in hot climate when the sweat ducts to the skin become blocked or swell, causing discomfort and itching.\r\nHeat cramps occur in muscles after exercise in hot climate because sweating causes the body to lose water, salt, and minerals (electrolytes).\r\nHeat oedema(swelling) in the legs and hands, can occur after sitting or standing for a long time in a hot environment.\r\nHeat tetany is usually caused by short periods of stress in a hot environment.\r\nHeat syncope (fainting) occurs from low blood pressure. Heat causes the blood vessels to expand (dilate) and body fluids move into the legs because of gravity.\r\nHeat exhaustion(heat prostration) generally develops when a person is working or exercising in hot weather and does not drink enough liquids to replace those lost liquids.\r\nHeat stroke (sun stroke) is a severe heat illness defined as hyperthermia with a body temperature greater than 40 \u00b0C (104\u00b0F) with neurologic dysfunction because of environmental heat exposure with lack ofthermoregulation (process by which the body maintains a steady temperature). It is also known as sun stroke.\r\n\r\nHeat stroke is a medical emergency. Even with immediate treatment, it can be life-threatening or cause serious long-term problems.\r\nHeat- related illness is a common problem in the tropics and with ever-increasing global warming its incidence is rising even in temperate climate. The highest incidence of heat illness of 45-1300/100000 persons is reported from Saudi Arabia.\r\nIn India, heat stroke (HS) occurs frequently in areas of northern and western India, and sporadic cases of exertional heat stroke (EHS) are reported in military recruits. In 2015, (April-June) recorded maximum temperature was 6\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C more than the average maximum temperature (mean daily maximum temperature) which resulted in 2422 human deaths due to heat wave. States of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand and Delhi are mostly affected by heat wave season.\r\nChildren, elderly persons, chronically ill persons, outdoor workers, pavement and slum dwellers, street venders and rickshaw pullers are at greater risk of heat related illnesses.\r\nGreater awareness about heat related illnesses will help in preventing, recognizing and treating these disorders at an early stage. Public education on heat illnesses, behavioural changes and restricted use of alcohol, enforced rests and fluid protocols, acclimatisation and ready availability of cooling facilities in hot areas will help in decreasing morbidity and mortality. Most heat-related illnesses can be prevented by keeping the body cool and by avoiding dehydration in hot environments.\r\nFind more information:\r\n\u201cGuidelines for Preparation of Action Plan \u2013 Prevention and Management of Heat-Wave\u201d, 2016 by National Disaster Management Authority, Government of India-\r\nndma.gov.in/images/guidelines"

                "As the body temperature increases, the body tries to maintain its normal temperature by transferring heat. Sweating and blood flow to the skin (Thermoregulation) help to keep body cool. A heat-related illness occurs when the body cannot transfer enough heat to keep the body cool. A high body temperature (hyperthermia) can develop rapidly in extremely hot environments.\r\nHeat-related illnesses produce a high body temperature because the body cannot transfer heat effectively or because external heat gain is excessive.(High temperature caused by a feveris different from a high body temperature caused by a heat-related illness. A fever is the body's normal reaction to infection and other conditions).\r\nHeat rash (Prickly heat) develops when the sweat ducts become blocked and swell. It is attributed to heavy sweating during hot and humid weather.\r\nHeat oedema develops when heat causes the blood vessels to expand (dilate) and body fluid moves into the hands or legs by gravity. If salt loss is less than normal, the increased salt level draws fluid into the hands and legs. Older adults have an increased risk of heat oedema, especially if they have other medical conditions that affect their circulation. People visiting hot climates from colder climates may also have an increased risk of heat oedema.\r\nHeat syncope occurs when heat causes the blood vessels to expand (dilate) in order to keep body cool; as a result blood flow to the brain is reduced causing fainting. Heat Syncope can also be caused as a result of blood collecting in the legs if an individual is standing for an extended period of time in the hot sun or as a result of doing rigorous physical activity for an extended amount of time out in the sun.\r\nHeat exhaustion occurs when body loses body fluids and salts (sweating), when exposed to high temperatures for long periods of time. It can develop when person works or exercises in hot weather and doesn't drink enough liquids to replace the fluids lost from sweating.\r\nHeat stroke results when the body fails to regulate its own temperature, and body temperature continues to rise. Heat stroke is the most serious heat-related disorder. It occurs when the body fails to regulate its own temperature, the body's temperature rises rapidly, the sweating mechanism fails, and the body is unable to cool down. The body temperature can rise to 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41.1 degree Celsius) or higher within 10 to 15 minutes. Heat stroke can cause death or permanent disability if prompt medical treatment is not given.\r\nThere are two forms of heat stroke:\r\n\r\nExertional heat stroke (EHS) generally occurs in young individuals who engage in strenuous physical activity for a prolonged period of time in a hot environment.\r\nClassic non-exertional heat stroke (NEHS) more commonly affects sedentary elderly individuals, persons who are chronically ill and very young children during environmental heat waves. Classic NEHS is more common in areas that do not experience periods of prolonged hot weather.\r\n\r\nRisk factors for heatstroke include male sex, sleep deprivation, obesity, poor physical conditioning, lack of acclimatization, diuretic therapy, dehydration, febrile illness, alcohol abuse, skin diseases that affect sweating, heavy protective gear, drugs impairing normal thermoregulatory response, and a past history of HS."

                "Hypermetropia (hyperopia, long-sightedness or far- sightedness) is a form of refractive error in which parallel rays of light coming from infinity are focused behind the light sensitive layer of the retina, when the eye is at rest.\r\nDonders (1864) discusses in his historical review about hypermetropia. Much of the problem was caused by confusion between the effects of presbyopia and hypermetropia on near vision.\r\nSmall hypermetropia may be corrected by voluntary accommodation. Even high errors of refraction may be corrected this way, but convex glasses may be required if symptoms are not relieved.\r\nEmmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. Refractive error (ametropia) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays, resulting in blurred images. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.\r\nIn hypermetropia, the cornea is flatter or the axial length is too short. Therefore, the images do not focus by the time they reach to the retina. For clear vision, a hypermetropic eye must accommodate to increase its lenticular power to bring distant objects in focus on retina. This requires contraction of ciliary muscle, and therefore, far-sighted eye is never at rest and work even harder to see near objects clearly. Hypermetropic corrections add positive focusing power to the eye for clear vision.\r\nAccommodation: The degree of hypermetropia corrected by accommodative effort is known as facultative hypermetropia. Remaining uncorrected hypermetropia is called absolute hypermetropia. Total hypermetropia after abolishing voluntary accommodation is known as manifest hypermetropia (facultative plus absolute). With advancing age, accommodative effort cannot be sustained, and hypermetropia becomes absolute till the effort of accommodation fails to correct any hypermetropia. Thus the facultative hypermetropia becomes abolished and there remains no difference between absolute and manifest hypermetropia.\r\nSome of the hypermetropia is corrected by the inherent tone of the ciliary muscles and this is called latent hypermetropia. The degree of latent hypermetropia is high in young persons and becomes less with advancing age. Complete cycloplegia (paralysis of accommodation) can abolish latent hypermetropia. The refractive error estimated under complete cycloplegia is called total hypermetropia (manifest plus latent)."

Patient present with:\r\n\r\nAsthenopia.\r\nDefective vision more for near.\r\n\r\nWhen hypermetropia is high: When hypermetropia is high (more than 4 D), the patients usually do not accommodate and they suffer with:\r\n\r\nMarked defective vision for both near and distance.\r\n\r\nWhen there is more of absolute hypermetropia: With ageing the eye move from latent and facultative hypermetropia to greater degrees of absolute hypermetropia. This leads to progressive defective vision. Patient present with:\r\n\r\nBlurring of vision at a younger age than in emmetrope.\r\n\r\nWhen there is Spasm of accommodation: Spasm of accommodation may induce pseudo-myopia.

About 1 mm increase in radius of curvature results in 6 D of hypermetropia.\r\nIndex Hypermetropia: Index Hypermetropia occurs due to change in refractive index of the crystalline lens with age.\r\nPositional hypermetropia: Positional hypermetropia results from posteriorly placed crystalline lens of the eye.\r\nAbsence of crystalline lens: Absence of crystalline lens either congenital absence or acquired (following surgical removal or posterior displacement) leads to aphakia. There is high hypermetropia in aphakia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may also be functional, as is seen in presbyopia or may be induced by cycloplegic drugs."

                "Diagnosis of hypermetropia is based on the symptoms and clinical signs observed.\r\nClinical signs:\r\n\r\nVisual acuity: Visual acuity varies with degree of hypermetropia and power of accommodation. Patients with low degree of refractive error may have normal visual acuity. However, there is decrease in visual acuity for seeing near objects.\r\nCover test: Cover test reveals an accommodative convergent squint. Due to altered accommodative convergence (AC) and accommodation (A) balance (AC/A ratio), maintaining binocular vision becomes difficult. The advantages of binocular vision are sacrificed in favour of more obvious advantages of clear vision. The better eye dominates for vision and the other eye develops accommodative convergent squint.\r\nEyelids: One may develop blepharitis, stye or chalazion. The correlation between lid conditions and hypermetropia is not clear.\r\nEyeball: Size of the eyeball may be normal or small.\r\nCornea: Cornea may also be slightly smaller in size. There may be associated condition of cornea plana (flat cornea).\r\nAnterior chamber: Anterior chamber is relatively shallow in high hypermetropia.\r\nGlaucoma: The eye is small in high hypermetropia along with small size of cornea and shallow anterior chamber. Due to increase in size of the lens with ageing, the eye becomes prone to an attack of narrow angle closure glaucoma.\r\nLens: Lens may be dislocated backwards.\r\nFundus: Fundus examination shows small optic disc which may look hyperaemic (vascular) with ill- defined margins. This appearance may simulate papillitis. Since there is no swelling of the disc, it is called pseudo-papillitis. The retina is shiny due to reflection of light, called as shot silk appearance. Reflex of retinal vessels may be accentuated simulating arteriosclerotic changes. Vessels may be tortuous and may show abnormal branching.\r\nUltrasonography or biometry: A- scan ultrasonography or biometry may show decreased antero- posterior length of the eyeball.\r\n\r\nSeverity of hypermetropia:\r\nBased on severity, hypermetropia may be classified as:\r\n\r\nLow: Up to + 2 D.\r\nModerate: From + 2.25 to 5 D.\r\nHigh: More than + 5 D, and rarely it exceeds 6 \u2013 7 D, which is equivalent to 2 mm shortening of the optic axis. Individual cases of much higher degrees (e.g. up to 24 D), without any other associated anomaly have been recorded.\r\n\r\nClinical types of hypermetropia:\r\nI. Simple hypermetropia: Simple hypermetropia is the commonest type. It includes axial and curvature hypermetropia due to biological variations in the development of the eye. It may be hereditary.\r\nII. Pathological hypermetropia: Pathological type is due to congenital or acquired conditions outside the normal biological variation of development. It may be\r\n\r\nSenile or acquired hypermetropia: It occurs in old age due to\r\n\r\n- Curvature hypermetropia: There is decreased curvature of the outer lens fibres with ageing.\r\n- Index hypermetropia: It is due to acquired sclerosis of the cortex (outer part) of crystalline lens. In young age, refraction of the cortex is less than nucleus (central part) of the lens. This inequality results in formation of a central lens surrounded by two converging menisci. This increases the refracting power of the lens. With ageing, this differentiation diminishes and the lens becomes more homogeneous with reduced converging power.\r\n\r\nPositional hypermetropia: It may occur due to posterior subluxation (partial dislocation) of the lens.\r\nAphakic hypermetropia: Aphakia is the displacement of the lens from its normal pupillary position in the eye. It may be congenital or acquired condition. The eye is hypermetropic with marked defective vision for near and distance. On an average there is need of + 10 or + 11 D lens for correction.\r\nConsecutive hypermetropia: It is due to surgically overcorrected myopia or pseudo-phakia (eye with intraocular lens following removal of crystalline lens as in cataract surgery) with under-correction.\r\n\r\nIII. Functional hypermetropia: It results from paralysis of accommodation as is seen in patients with third intracranial nerve palsy and internal ophthalmoplegia."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nMedical optical therapy:\r\nAssessment of Vision:\r\nThe most common component of assessment of visual function is to test central vision through visual acuity. Visual acuity determines ability to read symbols of varying sizes at a standard testing distance. This reference distance approximates optical infinity and is typically 6 meters. A 6/6 letter on the standard eye chart devised by Snellen is considered normal visual acuity. Refractive errors may result in uncorrected visual acuities that fall below 6/6. In the absence of other diseases, the condition of hypermetropia may be corrected with restoration of normal visual function. This may be achieved with spectacles or contact lenses.\r\nBasic principle of therapy is to converge and focus the light rays on the retina with the help of convex (plus) glasses.\r\nRules for prescribing glasses in hypermetropia:\r\n\r\nCycloplegia: Total hypermetropia is determined by performing refraction (checking power of glasses) under complete cycloplegia.\r\nSmall total manifest hypermetropia: For small total manifest hypermetropia e.g. 1 D or less, correction may be required only if the patient is symptomatic.\r\nSpherical power: Spherical power is prescribed to the extent that it is suitably acceptable to the patient.\r\nAstigmatism: Astigmatism should be fully corrected.\r\nChildren younger than 4 years: Children younger than 4 years requiring hypermetropic correction may usually accept full cycloplegic correction. It may be reduced in older children.\r\nOlder children: Older children may not accept full cycloplegic correction because of the blur for distance. It may be increased gradually till the child accepts for the manifest hypermetropia.\r\nExophoria: Hypermetropia should be under-corrected by about 1- 2 D if there is associated exophoria.\r\nAccommodative convergent squint: Full cycloplegic correction should be given if there is accommodative convergent squint.\r\nAmblyopia (lazy eye): In the presence of associated amblyopia (Functionally reduced vision not correctable with glasses and is not due to any eye disease) in one eye, full correction with occlusion therapy should be given.\r\nGrowth of child: Hypermetropia decreases with growth of the child. Periodic refraction should be conducted and the correction should be reduced accordingly.\r\n\r\nPrescription of convex power:\r\n\r\nSpectacles: Convex lenses may be prescribed as spectacles.\r\nContact lenses: Contact lenses may be prescribed for cosmetic reasons once the refractive power of the eye stabilises. Contact lenses may be prescribed for unilateral hypermetropia as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\nIt may be\r\n\r\nNon- contact Holmium:YAG laser thermokeratoplasty: Non- contact Holmium:YAG laser thermokeratoplasty is suitable for hypermetropia of about + 1 D to + 2.5 D. With this, multiple radially distributed spots are produced in the para-central cornea, which leads to shrinkage of the collagen in the mid- peripheral stroma and consequent steepening of the central cornea.\r\nHypermetropic photorefractive keratectomy (H- PRK): The principle of this procedure is to steepen the anterior corneal curvature. The cornea is sculpted in to a steeper convex lens by creating a furrow- like ring zone in the corneal periphery.\r\nConductive keratoplasty: Conductive keratoplasty is a non-invasive procedure in which radiofrequency is used to correct low hypermetropia with or without astigmatism. It may also be used to correct residual refractive error after cataract surgery or laser assisted in- situ keratomileusis.\r\nHypermetropic laser assisted in- situ keratomileusis (LASIK): It is used to correct mild- to- moderate hypermetropia varying from + 1 D to + 4 D.\r\nPhakic intraocular lens (IOL) implants: Phakic intraocular lens (IOL) implants are used to correct higher degrees of hypermetropia, varying from about + 4 D to + 10 D. Phakic IOLs are especially designed, foldable, convex, thin lenses implanted in the posterior chamber behind the iris and in front of the normal crystalline lens.\r\nRefractive lens exchange: Extraction of clear lens with implantation of an IOL, preferably foldable IOL or a piggyback IOL. In piggyback IOL, two IOLs are placed in the eye one on top of the other. This is done if the biometry is + 40 D or so, and one does not have a lens of high power to implant. Moreover, there is high level of spherical aberration with thick lenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nAsymptomatic children up to about 10 years with low to moderate hypermetropia usually do not require any glasses. Visual acuity decreases as the child grows due to loss of accommodation.\r\nHypermetropia decreases quality of life. Poor vision may also decrease in the ability to learn and develop. Hypermetropia that is not fully compensated with accommodation may produce complications."

                "Heterophoria or latent squint is defined as a condition in which eyes in the primary position or in their movement are maintained on the fixation point under stress only, with the aid of corrective fusion reflexes. When the influence of fusion is removed, the visual axis of one eye deviates.\r\nOrthophoria is characterised by perfect alignment of two eyes in all positions of gaze and at all fixation distances so that the visual axes are parallel for distance and have proper convergence for near. Orthophoria as such is a rarity. A small amount of heterophoria is usually present.\r\nGeorge T Stevens (1886) introduced the term heterophoria and defined it as an abnormal adjustment of the eye muscles, or a tending of the visual lines in some other direction than parallelism, which applies to strabismus as well. In heterophoria binocular vision is habitually maintained, but by the expenditure of a greater amount of force than is demanded in the perfect equilibrium of the ocular muscles. Thus, deviation is kept latent by the fusion mechanism. In strabismus, diplopia is present and to overcome this, there is long suppression of one image. Therefore, the dividing line between heterophoria and strabismus rests on the ability or failure to maintain binocular vision.\r\nThe term heterophoria is derived from a Greek word, heteros meaning other, different from; and phoria meaning bringing, comparing.\r\nAll the anomalies of ocular alignment are divided into two classes\r\n\r\nLatent deviation.\r\nManifest deviation.\r\n\r\nIn heterophoria there is relative deviation of the visual axis held in check by a fusion mechanism and when this mechanism is disrupted the phoria breaks into tropia (squint) and thus the deviation becomes manifest."

Exophoria is more often seen in elderly group.\r\n- Convergence: Excessive use of convergence may cause esophoria as is seen in bilateral congenital myopes. Decreased use of convergence leads to exophoria as is present in presbyopia (age-related diminution of vision).\r\n- Accommodation: Increased accommodation leads to esophoria as is seen in hypermetropia (far-sightedness) and also in individuals doing excessive near work. Decreased accommodation is associated with exophoria as is seen in simple myopia.\r\n- Dissociation factors: Prolonged constant use of one eye may result in exophoria. This is seen in people using uniocular microscope and in watchmakers using uniocular magnifying glass.\r\n\r\nNeurogenic causes: Lower motor neuron disease leads to incomitant heterophoria (deviations which vary with the direction of gaze) and upper motor neuron disease leads to comitant heterophoria (deviations are same in all directions of gaze for a particular fixation distance).\r\n\r\n\r\nRisk factors for de-compensated heterophoria include\r\n\r\nGeneral debility and lowered vitality.\r\nMental stress.\r\nInadequacy of fusion reserve.\r\nAdvancing age.\r\nPrecision jobs.\r\n\r\nSensorial adaptations such as abnormal retinal correspondence and suppression of image may develop to avoid foveal diplopia.

                "There are different methods for diagnosis of heterophorias. There is no reason to believe that heterophorias are of smaller magnitude as compared to heterotropia. Heterophoria may be as large as 25\u02da and heterotropia may be as small as 5\u02da (microtropia). Nature of deviation depends upon the degree of fusion amplitude.\r\nExamination of patient comprises of detailed history and determination of refractive error (retinoscopy) under cycloplegia. Ocular movements should also be tested in all positions of gaze. Important tests in the evaluation of heterophoria include\r\n\r\nCover- Uncover test: It should be performed for both distance and near. One eye of the patient is covered while fixating with other eye at a distant target. The eye is then uncovered and any movement of the eye to take up fixation is noted. The test is repeated with other eye. The direction of deviation, the degree of deviation and speed of recovery is noted. If the right eye is deviated while under cover, a re-fixation movement (recovery to BSV) is observed on being uncovered. Adduction of the right eye indicates exophoria and abduction esophoria. Upward or downward movement indicates a vertical phoria. After the cover is removed, the speed and smoothness of recovery indicates the strength of motor fusion.\r\nAlternate cover test: The alternate cover test induces dissociation to reveal total deviation when fusion is disrupted. It is performed after cover-uncover test. The occluder is shifted quickly back and forth from one eye to other, several times. After the cover is removed, the speed and smoothness of recovery is noted as the eyes return to their pre- dissociated state. A patient with well compensated heterophoria will have straight eyes before and after the test has been performed, whereas a patient with poor control may decompensate to manifest deviation.\r\nMaddox rod test: The Maddox rod consists of a series of fused cylindrical red glass rods that convert the appearance of a white spot of light in to a red streak. The optical property of rod causes the streak of light to be at an angle of 90\u02da with the long axis of the rods. The Maddox rod is placed in front of one eye and patient fixates with both eyes on a spot of light. The patient is asked whether the streak produced by Maddox rod passes through the fixation light seen by the other eye. When rod is placed horizontally, a vertical streak is produced and it gives an idea about exophoria or esophoria. But a vertically placed rod produce horizontal streak, and it delineates hyper- or hypophoria. Prisms may be inserted in front of one eye to make the streak pass through the point of fixation, which estimates the degree of error. Maddox tangent scale placed at one meter or five meters may be used to measure degree of heterophoria directly from the scale.\r\nMaddox wing test: This is used to measure degree of heterophoria at near fixation. The instrument is constructed in such a way that the right eye sees only a white vertical arrow and a red horizontal arrow, whereas the left eye sees only horizontal and vertical rows of numbers. Patient rests the front piece of Maddox wing on nose and looks through the slit in eyepieces. Right eye of patient sees white scale and the left eye sees arrow. The number on scale through which white arrow passes, gives the measurement of horizontal heterophoria. Similarly, reading on vertical scale measures vertical phorias. Cyclophoria may be found by adjusting shaft of red arrow parallel to the horizontal scale.\r\nSynoptophore: This may also be used to measure degree of heterophoria.\r\nNear point of convergence: The near point of convergence is the nearest point on which the eyes can maintain binocular fixation. It may be measured with royal air force (RAF) rule, which rests on cheeks of patient. A target is slowly moved along the rule towards the eyes of patient until one eye loses fixation and drifts laterally. The subjective near point of convergence is the point at which the patient reports diplopia. Normally, the near point of convergence should be nearer than 10 centimeter without undue effort.\r\nNear point of accommodation: The near point of accommodation is the nearest point on which the eyes can maintain clear focus. It may also be measured with the RAF rule. The patient fixates a line of print, which is then slowly moved towards the patient until it becomes blurred. The distance at which blurring is reported first is read off the rule and it denotes the near point of accommodation. The near point of accommodation recedes with age. When near point of accommodation recedes sufficiently far away to render reading difficult without optical correction, presbyopia is present.\r\nMeasurement of fusion reserves: Fusion amplitudes measure the efficacy of vergence movements. These may be tested with prisms bars or the synoptophore. An increasingly strong prism is placed in front of one eye, which then abduct or adduct (depending on whether the prism is base-in or base-out), in order to maintain bifoveal fixation. When a prism of greater than fusion amplitude is reached, diplopia occurs or one eye drifts in the opposite direction, indicating the limit of vergence ability.\r\nAssessment of binocular vision.\r\n\r\n\r\nClinical types of heterophoria: These are\r\n\r\nExophoria: It is characterised by a tendency of the eyes to diverge, which is checked by fusion amplitudes. It is a passive process unlike esophoria (which is an active process). An exophoria of less than 9 prism dioptres is usually not significant. There are three types of exophoria\r\n\r\n- Divergence excess type.\r\n- Basic type.\r\n- Convergence weakness type.\r\n\r\nEsophoria: It is characterised by a tendency of the eyes to deviate inwards, which is held in check by fusion impulses. It is either due to hypermetropic refractive error or high accommodative convergence/ accommodation (AC/A) ratio or increased amount of near work. There are three types of esophorias.\r\n\r\n- Convergence excess type.\r\n- Basic type.\r\n- Divergence weakness type.\r\n\r\nHyperphoria: Hyperphoria is characterised by a tendency of the eyes to deviate upwards in a vertical direction, which is held in check by fusion amplitudes.\r\nHypophoria: Hypophoria is characterised by a tendency of the eyes to deviate downwards in a vertical direction, which is held in check by fusion amplitudes.\r\nCyclophoria: Cyclophoria is characterised by a tendency of the eyes to rotate around their sagittal axis (antero-posterior), which is held in check by fusion amplitudes. This can be\r\n\r\n- Incyclophoria: Incyclophoria is characterised by inward rotation of the upper pole of the cornea.\r\n- Excyclophoria: Excyclophoria is characterised by outward rotation of the upper pole of the cornea.\r\n\r\nAnisophoria: Anisophoria is that type of heterophoria in which the degree of muscular imbalance varies with the direction of conjugate gaze.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis:\r\nHeterophoria should be differentiated from heterotropias."

Optical: \r\n\r\nEsophoria: \r\n\r\n- Full correction of the refractive error is given to the patient when refraction shows significant amount of hypermetropia (+1.25 dioptres or more).\r\n- Patients with high AC/A ratio and a symptomatic esophoria without hypermetropia may be treated with miotics or bifocal glasses.\r\n- Base-out prisms for visual comfort in patients with non-accommodative esophoria. To prevent total inactivity of fusion divergence mechanism, one-half to one-third only of the angle of deviation is corrected. This does not correct underlying cause of latent deviation. It is used mainly in elderly patients with symptomatic esophoria who do not respond to orthoptic treatment. It may also be used in younger patients prior to surgery.\r\n\r\nExophoria:\r\n\r\n- Patients without asthenopia do not require any treatment.\r\n- Significant refractive errors, especially anisometropia, aniseikonia, aphakia, intraocular lens (IOL) with wrong power (pseudophakia), and astigmatism, should be treated to produce sharp retinal images which increase stimulus to fuse. Hypermetropia of less than 2 Dioptres may be left uncorrected in children, though in older patients this needs to be corrected to avoid asthenopia. Presbyopia patients are given the weakest bifocal lenses which provide comfortable near vision. Half of exodeviation may be treated with base-in prisms for near vision. Myopic errors are fully corrected.\r\n- Minus lenses may decrease exodeviation in patients with high AC/A ratio.\r\n- In younger children with convergence insufficiency exodeviation, minus lenses as lower segment bifocals may be tried, as a temporary measure. In divergence excess exodeviation, minus lenses as upper segment bifocals may be tried.\r\n- Prisms may be used for postoperative overcorrection of exodeviation. It is sometimes used preoperatively to enforce bifoveal stimulation.\r\n\r\nHyperphoria:\r\n\r\n- Prisms in glasses may also be tried in selective cases of hyperphoria. The prism is prescribed with the apex toward the direction of hyperphoria to correct one-half or at the most two-third of heterophoria only.\r\nII. Orthoptics:\r\nThis is the mainstay of treatment. Patients with moderate degrees of exophoria or esophoria who have fair degree of binocular function, orthoptic execises are the treatment of choice. Patients with convergence insufficiency are given convergence exercises on synoptophore. Likewise, patient with divergence insufficiency are given divergence exercises.\r\nIII. Miotic drugs:\r\nMiotic drugs may be useful in near esophoria due to high AC/A ratio. These facilitate peripheral accommodation so that less than normal innervation is required and consequently less than normal accommodative convergence occurs.\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\nThis is indicated in patients with intermittent exotropia who show signs of worsening in the form of\r\n\r\nExotropia lasts for more than 50% of the waking hours.\r\nThere are symptoms of asthenopia or diplopia.\r\nPatient develops abnormal retinal correspondence or suppression.\r\nThere is decrease in stereo-acuity.\r\nThere is development of secondary convergence insufficiency.\r\nThere is increase in deviation.\r\n\r\nThe aim of surgical procedure is to strengthen the weak muscle or to weaken the strong muscle. Elderly patients should be treated conservatively due to decreased fusion capacity. Younger patients with small surgical overcorrection may be easily treated by fusion convergence since the fusion capacity is good.\r\nSurgical procedures which may be performed are\r\n\r\nBi-medial recession: Bi-medial recession is done in cases of convergence excess.\r\nBilateral resection: Bilateral resection is done in cases of divergence insufficiency."

Toxicity is produced with chronic intake of 6000\u03bcg of vitamin A in children, and 15000\u03bcg of vitamin A in adults.\r\nJosephs HW first described the condition of hypervitaminosis A in 1944. \r\nSymptoms of hypervitaminosis A may subside rapidly on withdrawal of vitamin, but the rate at which improvement takes place depends upon the amount of vitamin A already built up in the tissues. Hypervitaminosis A may prove fatal in extreme cases. Hypervitaminosis A has no antidote. Thus, prevention plays an important role to avoid toxicity.\r\nExcept for vitamin A, toxicity from excess intake of vitamins, in general, is less common. Excessive intake of carotene (precursor of vitamin A) may lead to pigmentation of skin (hypercarotenosis). This gets reduced and fades away when intake of carotene is reduced."

The term high risk pregnancy is used by health care providers to demarcate a pregnancy in which a mother, her foetus or both are at higher risk of developing complications during pregnancy or child birth than in a normal pregnancy. Women with high-risk pregnancies should receive care from a special team of health care providers to ensure the best possible outcomes.\r\nHigh risk pregnancy may result because of various conditions which are there either before getting pregnant such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and complications from a previous pregnancy, or conditions during pregnancy or delivery.\r\nIn India about 20-30% pregnancies belong to high risk category, which is responsible for 75% of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Early detection and effective management of high risk pregnancy can contribute substantially in reduction of maternal and foetal adverse outcomes.\r\nPradhan Mantri Surakshit Matriva Abhiyan is an initiative of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Government of India to identify high risk pregnancies early and follow them so that they can be referred to health care centers with proper facilities so that women with high risk pregnancies may have healthy pregnancies and deliveries without complications."

                "Though any pregnancy could develop complications during or after pregnancy and child birth, but a pregnancy with high risk factor poses higher than normal risk for the pregnant women and fetus.\r\nSome common high risk conditions of pregnancy are:\r\nMaternal age: Early childbearing is a risk for both mother and new born. Adolescent mothers (ages 10 to 19 years) face higher risks of eclampsia, puerperal endometritis, and systemic infections than women aged 20 to 24 years. And newborns can have higher risks of low birthweight, preterm delivery, and severe neonatal problems.\r\nAdvanced maternal age (defined as childbearing in a woman over 35 years of age) is reported to be associated with various pregnancy complications such as risk of stillbirth, foetal growth restriction, an increased risk of caesarean birth, premature birth, birth defects, multiple births, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, preeclampsia.\r\nMedical conditions that exist before pregnancy, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, sexually transmitted diseases or being HIV positive, kidney diseases, autoimmune diseases, thyroid diseases can present risks for the mother and/or her unborn baby.\r\nMedical condition that occur during pregnancy may affect pregnancy and outcome such as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, placenta previa, polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios.\r\nMultiple births.The risk of complications is higher in women carrying more than one fetus (twins and higher-order multiples). Common complications include preeclampsia, premature labor, and preterm birth.\r\nObesity.Being obese before pregnancy is associated with a number of risks for poor pregnancy outcomes.\r\nAlcohol, tobacco and substance use-Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can increase the baby\u2019s risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), sudden infant death syndrome, and other problems. Smoking during pregnancy may cause fetus at risk for preterm birth, birth defects, sudden infant death. Secondhand smoke also puts a woman and her developing fetus at increased risk for health problems.\r\nZika infection: Infection with zika just before and during pregnancy is a risk factor for different problems with the brain and nervous system of foetus, pregnancy loss and stillbirth."

Sometimes a tissue sample can help in confirming a diagnosis.\r\nX-ray:A standard X-ray of abdominal area may be done to rule out toxic mega colon or a perforation of the colon, if these conditions are suspected because of severe symptoms.\r\nFlexible sigmoidoscopy:In this procedure, doctor uses a slender, flexible, lighted tube to examine the last portion of colon (sigmoid colon).\r\nBarium enema:This diagnostic test allows to evaluate the entire large intestine with an X-ray. Barium, a contrast solution, is placed into the bowel using an enema. Sometimes, air is added as well. The barium coats the bowel lining, creating a silhouette image of rectum, colon and a portion of the small intestine. This test is rarely and can be dangerous because the pressure required to inflate and coat the colon can lead to rupture of the colon.\r\nComputerized tomography (CT) scan:A CT scan of the abdomen or pelvis may be performed if physician suspects a complication from ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. A CT scan may also reveal how much of the colon is inflamed.\r\nStool sample:The presence of white blood cells in the stool indicates an inflammatory disease, possibly IBD. A stool sample is done to rule out other disorders, such as those caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites.\r\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI):An MRI scanner uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of organs and tissues. Most MRI machines are large, tube-shaped magnets. During the test, the patient lies on a movable table inside the MRI machine. This test is very helpful in diagnosing and managing Crohn's disease. Its biggest advantage is that there is no radiation exposure. It\u2019s particularly useful for evaluating a fistula around the anal area (pelvic MRI) or the small intestine (MRI enterography).\r\nCapsule endoscopy:If there are symptoms that suggest Crohn's disease but other diagnostic tests are negative, the physician may perform capsule endoscopy. For this test patient needs to swallow a capsule that has a tiny camera in it. The camera takes pictures as it moves through the digestive tract, and the images are transmitted to a computer. The physician can see the images, which are then displayed on a monitor and checked for signs of Crohn's disease. Once it has made the trip through the digestive system, the camera exits the body painlessly in stool.\r\nDouble-balloon endoscopy:For this test, a longer scope is used where standard endoscopes don't reach. This technique is useful when capsule endoscopy shows abnormalities but the diagnosis is still not clear. It allows for biopsy of the abnormal area. It's usually performed in specialized endoscopy centers.\r\n\r\nIf one suspect IBD, he/ she should consult physician for further diagnosis and treatment."

                "Insomnia or sleeplessness, is a disorder characterized by an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep for a desired duration. Insomnia is generally seen as both a sign and a symptom that can accompany several sleep, medical, and psychiatric disorders characterized by a persistent difficulty falling asleep. Insomnia is typically followed by functional impairment while awake. Insomnia can occur at any age, but it is particularly common in the elderly.\r\nTypes of insomnia: Insomnia can be classified as acute, or chronic.\r\n1.Acute insomnia: It is the inability to sleep well for a period of less than a month. Insomnia is present when there is difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or when the sleep that is obtained is non-refreshing or of poor quality. These types of insomnia occurs despite there is adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep, and they must result in problems with daytime function. Acute insomnia is also known as short term insomnia or stress related insomnia.\r\n2.Chronic insomnia: It lasts for more than a month. It can be caused by another disorder, or it can be a primary disorder. People with high levels of stress hormones or shifts in the levels of cytokines are more likely to have chronic insomnia. Its effects can vary according to its causes. They might include muscular fatigue, hallucinations, and/or mental fatigue. Those people that live with this disorder have hallucinations and tend to see things as if they are happening in slow motion. Chronic insomnia can cause double vision."

So if a person loses blood, he or she will lose some iron. Women with heavy periods are at high risk of iron deficiency anemia as blood is lost during menstruation. Slowly, chronic blood loss within the body such as from a peptic ulcer, a hiatus hernia, a colon polyp or colorectal cancer can also cause iron-deficiency anemia. It can also be due to conditions like hemorrhoids, gastritis (inflammation of the stomach),and cancer, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as aspirin or ibuprofen, which can cause ulcers and gastritis.\r\nLack of iron in the diet:The body regularly gets iron from the food we eat. If a person consumes too little iron, over time the body can become iron-deficient. Examples of iron-rich foods include meat, eggs, leafy green vegetables and iron-fortified foods. For proper growth and development, infants and children need iron from their diet.\r\nAn inability to absorb iron: Iron from food is absorbed into the bloodstream in the small intestine. An intestinal disorder such as celiac disease, which affects the intestine's ability to absorb nutrients from digested food, can lead to iron-deficiency anemia. If part of the small intestine has been bypassed or removed surgically, that may affect the ability to absorb iron and other nutrients.\r\nPregnancy: Without iron supplementation, iron deficiency anemia occurs in many pregnant women because iron stores need to serve their own increased blood volume as well as be a source of hemoglobin for the developing fetus."

There are two kinds of infertility - primary and secondary:\r\nPrimary infertility means that the couple has never conceived. Secondary infertility means that the couple has experienced a pregnancy before and failed to conceive later. Globally, most infertile couples suffer from primary infertility.\r\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs) are the leading preventable cause of infertility by causing 70% of pelvic inflammatory diseases responsible for tubal damage. Low fertility is becoming more common worldwide, particularly in many urban settings where women are planning their first babies at older ages.\r\nInfertility affects up to 15% of reproductive-aged couples worldwide. According to World Health Organization estimate the overall prevalence of primary infertility in India is between 3.9 to 16.8%. In Indian states prevalence of infertility varies from state to state such as 3.7 per cent in Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Maharashtra, to 5 per cent in Andhra Pradesh, and 15 per cent in Kashmir and prevalence varies in same region across tribes and caste.\r\nThe inability to have children affects couples and causes emotional and psychological distress in both men and women. Despite the various social, psychological, economic and physical implications, infertility prevention and care often remain neglected public health issues, or at least they rank low on the priority list, especially for low-income countries that are already under population pressure. But in recent years there is increased awareness to integrate infertility prevention, care and treatment into the basic health care services."

In remaining cases infertility may be due to problems in both partners or the cause is unclear.\r\nFemale infertility can be caused by a number of factors:\r\n(a)Damage to fallopian tubes:Damage to the fallopian tubes (carry the eggs from the ovaries to the uterus) can prevent contact between the egg and sperm. Pelvic inflammatory diseases (PID) caused by various infections, endometriosis, pelvic surgery may lead to damage to fallopian tubes. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are the common cause of PIDs. \r\n(b)Disturb ovarian function/hormonal causes: Synchronized hormonal changes occur during the menstrual cycle leading to the release of an egg from the ovary (ovulation) and the thickening of the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) in preparation for the fertilized egg (embryo) to implant inside the uterus. Difficulty in ovulation is seen in following conditions-\r\n\r\nPolycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS)Polycystic ovary syndrome is the common cause of female infertility. PCOS interferes with normal ovulation.\r\nFunctional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Excessive physical (common in athletes) or emotional stress may result in amenorrhoea (absence of periods).\r\nDiminished ovarian reserve or premature ovarian aging: women with diminished ovarian reserve may experience difficulty in conceiving, (though blood test will show elevated follicular stimulating hormones).\r\nPremature ovarian insufficiency: Female ovaries stop working before she is 40 years of age. The cause can be natural or it can be a disease, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation.\r\n\r\n(c)Uterine causes:Abnormal anatomy of the uterus; the presence of polyps and fibroids may lead to infertility.\r\n(d)Cervical causes: A small group of women may have a cervical condition in which the sperm cannot pass through the cervical canal due to abnormal mucus production or a prior cervical surgical procedure.\r\nMale factors causing infertility-\r\nMore than 90% of male infertility cases are due to low sperm counts, poor sperm quality, or both. The remaining cases of male infertility can be caused by number of factors including anatomical problems, hormonal imbalances, and genetic defects. Sperm abnormalities include:\r\n\r\nOligospermia (low sperm counts) /Azoospermia (no sperms): sperm count less than 20 million/ml is termed as oligospermia whereas azoospermia refers to the complete absence of sperm cells in the ejaculate.\r\nAsthenospermia (Poor sperm motility): If 60% or more sperms have abnormal motility (movement is slow and not in straight line) it is termed as asthenospermia and may cause infertility.\r\nTeratospermia (abnormal sperm morphology): about 60% of the sperms should be normal in size and shape for adequate fertility.\r\n\r\nDifferent factors including congenital birth defects, diseases (such as mumps), chemical exposure, and life style habits can cause sperm abnormalities.\r\nFactors that affect the fertility of both sexes include the following:\r\n\r\nEnvironmental/occupational factors\r\nToxic effects related to tobacco, marijuana, or other drugs\r\nExcessive exercise\r\nInadequate diet associated with extreme weight loss or gain\r\nAdvanced age"

Full history includes: present history; menstrual and obstetric history (in female partner); contraceptive and sexual history; family and past history.\r\n(b)Clinical examination: Full clinical examination of both partners is required for detection of any physical problem. It includes general examination along with examination of chest, breast, abdomen, and genitalia. It helps to health care professional to make a provisional diagnosis. Investigations are advised to prove the clinical diagnosis and to exclude other close possible causes.\r\n(c) Investigations: Infertile couples are usually advised to start their investigations after 12 months of trying to conceive or after six months if the female partner is more than 35 years old or immediately if there is an obvious cause for their infertility or subfertility.\r\nAs the major causes of infertility are sperm abnormalities, ovulation dysfunction, and fallopian tube obstruction, the preliminary investigations for the infertile couple should be focused on:\r\nSemen analysis: It should be done after 72 hours of sexual abstinence and two analysis should be advised with 3 months apart at the same lab.(Results may be interpreted for its volume, sperm count, motility, and morphology according to the WHO reference values*).\r\nFemale partner\r\n\r\nDetection of ovarian function:\r\nHormonal assay (early follicular FSH and LH levels, and mid-luteal progesterone levels),\r\nTransvaginal ultrasonography is used for detection of ovulation in females and any abnormality in uterus and adnexa (adjoining anatomical parts of the uterus).\r\nEvaluation of tubal patency:\r\n\r\nHysterosalpingography (HSG): It is a radiological procedure.

Spilling of dye into the abdominal cavity shows that tubes are patent.\r\n\r\nAdvanced investigations-\r\n\r\nHormonal assay: Thyroid function test, prolactin levels, testosterone, and other tests if polycystic ovary syndrome is suspected.\r\nLaparoscopy is a surgical procedure used to visualize abdominal and pelvic organs (uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries).\r\nHysteroscopy is indicated for intrauterine space-occupying lesions detected on HSG\r\nChromosomal karyotyping is used for suspected genetic disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\nMale partner-\r\n\r\nHormonal assay: FSH, LH, Testosterone, TSH and Prolactin (for male with abnormal seminal analysis and suspected endocrine disorder)\r\nTesticular biopsy: A fine-needle aspiration biopsy to differentiate between obstructive and non-obstructive azoospermia.\r\nChromosomal karyotyping is used for suspected genetic disorders."

Management of STIs and PCOS can be viewed on www.nhp.gov.in.\r\nWhen initial treatments don't work, couple may decide for assisted reproduction technology.\r\nAssisted reproduction techniques (ART):\r\n\r\nIntrauterine insemination (IUI): IUI is the placement of a man's sperm into a woman's uterus using a long, narrow tube. IUI may be used in the following conditions.\r\nDefects of cervix\r\nLow sperm counts\r\nSperm with low motility\r\nErection problems in male partner\r\nRetrograde ejaculation (a condition in which sperms are deposited in to the bladder instead of going out through the urethra)\r\nWomen who have scarring or defects of the cervix.\r\n\r\nIUI is of two types\r\n\r\nartificial insemination by husband (AIH);\r\ndonor insemination (DI).\r\nIn vitro fertilization (IVF): In vitro fertilization, eggs and sperm are taken from the couple and are incubated together in a dish in a laboratory to produce an embryo. Medical specialist places the embryo into the woman's uterus, where it may implant and develop in a successful pregnancy.\r\nGamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT): in this procedure fertilization occurs naturally after eggs and sperm are placed inside the fallopian tube.\r\nZygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT): In ZIFT fertilized eggs are transferred to fallopian tube within 24 hours after fertilization. \r\nIntracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI): In this procedure single sperm is injected in to mature egg. It is used to treat sperm related infertility problems. \r\n\r\nSurrogate and gestational carriers-If a woman is unable to carry a pregnancy to term, the couple may choose a surrogate or gestational carrier.\r\n\r\nA surrogate is a woman inseminated with sperm from the male partner of the couple. The resulting child will be biologically related to the surrogate and to the male partner. Surrogacy can be used when the female of the couple does not produce healthy eggs that can be fertilized.\r\nA gestational carrier is implanted with an embryo that is not biologically related to her. This alternative can be used when a female partner produces healthy eggs but is unable to carry a pregnancy to term. Egg or sperm donation can be used in this situation."

                "Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a common complication of pregnancy in developing countries, and carries an increased risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity. IUGR refers to a condition in which foetus (an unborn baby) is smaller or less developed than normal for the baby's gender and gestational age. Gestational age is the age of a foetus or baby that starts on the first day of the mother's last menstrual period.\r\nIn IUGR foetal weight is below the 10th percentile for gestational age as estimated by an ultrasound. At term, the birth weight less than 2,500 g (5lb, or 8oz) is considered as IUGR. Small for gestational age or fetal growth restriction are the other terms used for IUGR. The term intrauterine growth restriction has largely replaced the term intrauterine growth retardation.\r\nIUGR is classified into two types-\r\n\r\nSymmetricorprimaryIUGR: In this condition all internal organs are reduced in size. It is found in 20%-30% of all cases of IUGR.\r\nAsymmetricorsecondaryIUGR: In this condition the head and brain are normal in size, but the abdomen is smaller. It is evident mostly in the 3rdtrimester. It is more common and found in 70% to 80% of total IUGR cases.\r\n\r\nIntrauterine growth restriction is observed in about 24% of newborns. In Asia IUGR accounts for nearly 75% of all affected infants. After prematurity IUGR is the second leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality.\r\nGrowth-restricted pregnancies are often complicated by a high rate of antepartum and intrapartum fetal distress and the need for cesarean delivery. These infants have many acute neonatal problems that include perinatal asphyxia, hypothermia (low body temperature), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), and polycythemia (increased red blood cells), jaundice, feeding difficulties, feed intolerance, necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis, and pulmonary hemorrhage.\r\nWhen IUGR infants grow up long-term complications include growth retardation, neurodevelopment defects may occur. These infants are more likely to develop adult onset diseases because of fetal epigenetic changes.\r\nTimely diagnosis (by assessment of fetal growth at each prenatal visit) and management of IUGR are the major activities in reducing perinatal morbidity and mortality."

                "One of the most important things when diagnosing IUGR is to know accurate gestational age of baby. Gestational age can be calculatedby using the first day of last menstrual period (LMP) and alsoby early ultrasound calculations. Once the gestational age is known the following methods can be used to diagnose IUGR.\r\nFundal height: It is the simplest and most common method to diagnose IUGR. Fundal height is size of uterus measured as the distance from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus in centimeters. After the 20th week of pregnancy, the measure in centimeters usually corresponds with the number of weeks of pregnancy. A lag in fundal height of 4 cm or more suggests IUGR.\r\nWeight checkups:Doctors routinely check and record the mother's weight at every prenatal checkup. If a mother is not gaining weight properly, it could indicate a growth problem in her baby.\r\nUltrasound: It is used to measure the baby's head and abdomen and compared with growth charts to estimate the baby's weight. Ultrasound can also be used to determine amniotic fluid.\r\nDoppler assessment: It is a technique that uses sound waves to measure the amount and speed of blood flow through the blood vessels. Doctors may use this test to check the flow of blood in the umbilical cord and vessels in the baby's brain. Abnormal Doppler tests are diagnostic of IUGR."

Any condition that disrupts the movement of bilirubin from the blood to the liver and out of the bodycan cause jaundice.Bilirubinis a yellow pigment that is formed by the breakdown of dead red blood cells (RBC) in the liver.There are several ways that a build- up of bilirubin can occur:\r\n\r\nIf red blood cells broke down too early, the spleen gets overloaded and hence too much bilirubin is produced to be handled by the liver. Unprocessed bilirubin accumulates in the bloodstream and eventually the skin and eyes looks yellow. This condition is called hemolytic anemia. At times this condition is inherited. Hemolytic anemia may also occur as a side-effect of certain drugs.\r\nSometimes the trouble is in the liver cells. If there is a faulty uptake, processing or excretion of bilirubin it will result in an accumulation of bilirubin in the bloodstream. Newborn babies can be temporarily jaundiced because of lack of mature enzymes needed to process bilirubin. In adults,alcoholismis a common cause of damage to liver cells. Other toxins and certain drugs can also cause acute damage to the liver.\r\nA blockage in the bile duct can also result in a build-up of fully processed bilirubin. This can spill over into the urine and cause it to become very dark. The blockage is most commonly caused by a gallstone."

Causes of haemolysis include:\r\n\r\nMalaria\r\nSickle cell anemia\r\nThalassaemia\r\nGilbert syndrome\r\n\r\nHepatocellular jaundice:Hepato cellular jaundice can be due to any infection in the liver. It can be due to infection or exposure to a harmful substance, such as alcohol, disrupts the liver\u2019s ability to process bilirubin.\r\nPost hepatic jaundice:Post-hepatic jaundice, is also called as obstructive jaundice, is caused by an interruption to the drainage of bile in the biliary system. The most common cause is due to gallstone in the common bile duct or due to pancreatic cancer. Some underlying conditions that may cause jaundice are:\r\n\r\nAcute inflammation of the liver- May impair the ability of the liver to conjugate and secrete bilirubin, resulting in a buildup of bilirubin.\r\nInflammation of the bile duct- May prevent the secretion of bile and removal of bilirubin, causing jaundice.\r\nObstruction of the bile duct- Prevents the liver from disposing of bilirubin, which results in hyperbilirubinemia.\r\nHemolytic anemia- Production of bilirubin increases when large quantities of erythrocytes are broken down.\r\nGilbert's syndrome- An inherited condition that impairs the ability of enzymes (biomolecules that provoke chemical reactions between substances) to process the excretion of bile.\r\nCholestasis- A condition in which the flow of bile from the liver is interrupted.

For genetic blood disorders, such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, blood transfusions may be required to replace the red blood cells.\r\nGilbert's syndrome doesn't usually require treatment because the jaundice associated with the condition isn't particularly serious and doesn't pose a serious threat to health.\r\nIntra-hepatic jaundice\r\nIn cases of intra-hepatic jaundice, there's little that can be done to repair any liver damage, although the liver can often repair itself over time. Therefore, the aim of treatment is to prevent any further liver damage occurring.\r\nFor liver damage that's caused by infection, such as viral hepatitis or glandular fever, anti-viral medications may be used to help prevent further damage.\r\nIf the damage is due to exposure to harmful substances, such as alcohol or chemicals, avoiding any further exposure to the substance is recommended.\r\nIn severe cases of liver disease, a liver transplant is another possible option.\r\n\r\nPost-Hepatic Jaundice\r\nIn most cases of post-hepatic jaundice, surgery is recommended to unblock the bile duct system.\r\n\r\nDuring surgery, it might be required to remove:\r\n\r\nThe gallbladder\r\nA section of the bile duct system\r\nA section of the pancreas to prevent further blockages occurring\r\n\r\nNHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health.

                "Diagnosis and treatment of Kala-Azar are problematic because of a variety of reasons. While treatment is lengthy and relatively costly, definitive diagnosis of Kala-Azar requires tissue specimens, which are conventionally obtained by organ needle aspiration for microscopic demonstration of amastigote forms in stained smears. Bone marrow the spleen, and lymph-node (in some regions) are the tissues most often sampled in patients with suspected infection. The diagnostic sensitivity of splenic aspiration is high (95% - 98%), but the procedure carries a risk of bleeding; the sensitivity of examination of bone marrow specimens is considered to be lower (53% - 95%). Organ aspiration and accurate examination of smears also require technical skills that are not uniformly available in rural areas. Culture or PCR testing of aspirate material improves parasitologic yield, but these methods are seldom undertaken outside of research laboratories.\r\nSome of the drugs available for treatment of Kala-Azar in India:\r\n\r\nSodium Stibogluconate\r\nPentamidine Isethianate\r\nAmphotericin B\r\nLiposomal Amphotericin B\r\nMiltefosine\r\n\r\nThis is just indicative information.

                "Dry eye should be distinguished from other diseases affecting anterior surface of the eye e.g. conjunctivitis, infectious diseases, corneal abnormalities or keratopathies. Diagnosis depends upon clinical examination of eyes and conduct of certain specialised tests.\r\nTear film may show :\r\n1. Increase in mucous strands due to accumulation of lipid contaminated mucin in the tear film. Mucous debris move with blinking.\r\n2. Normally marginal tear meniscus is about 1mm high and convex. In dry eye, it is concave or absent altogether.\r\n3. Froth in the tear film or along the lid margin.\r\nCorneal examination may show :\r\n1. Punctate lesions on cornea.\r\n2. Mucous plaque formation. These are slightly elevated lesions on cornea.\r\n3. Corneal filaments with one end attached to cornea and are very painful.\r\nTear film break-up time (BUT) :\r\nThis is the interval between last blink and the appearance of first dry spot.\r\nFluorescein dye is instilled in the eye and patient blinks to spread it and then stops blinking. Eye is examined under cobalt blue filter. After an interval, appearance of black spots or lines indicate formation of dry areas. Formation of dry area at same spot shows local corneal abnormality and is ignored. A BUT of less than 10 seconds suggests dry eye.\r\nRose Bengal test :\r\nRose Bengal dye stains mucus, dead and devitalised cells on cornea, being produced by dry eye. Use a small drop only since it causes ocular irritation, but local anaesthesia should not be instilled to avoid false positive results.\r\nLissamine green test :\r\nLissamine green dye stains both, healthy cells not covered by mucin as well as devitalised or dead cells. It does not cause irritation and stinging sensation like Rose Bengal dye but staining is more transient. \r\nSchirmer\u2019s test :\r\nThis test measures wetting of special filter paper ( Whatmann No.41) ,which is 35 mm long and 5 mm wide, when placed at the junction of middle and outer third of the lower eye lid. Eye is dried gently and patient keep eyes open and blinks as necessary. It measures basic and reflex secretion(Schirmer\u2019s test 1). But when this test is done under topical anaesthesia(Schirmer\u2019s test 2), it measures basic secretion mainly, since it reduces reflex secretion but does not abolish it completely.\r\nWetting is measured after 5 minutes. Less than 10 mm of wetting without anaesthesia and less than 6 mm of wetting after anaesthesia is considered abnormal.\r\nInflammaDrytest (Rapid Pathogen Screening Inc), 2013 :\r\nInflammaDrytest is a recent, FDA approved, rapid in-office test taking less than 2 minutes. It measures inflammatory marker matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels in tears. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 level is elevated in the tears of patients with dry eye disease.\r\nImpression cytology:\r\nImpression cytology determines population of mucin secreting goblet cells. It helps to monitor progression of ocular surface changes leading to dry eye.\r\nQuantitative measurement of tear components :\r\nMeasurement of tear film osmolarity or analysis of tear proteins aids in diagnosis of dry eye.\r\nOther tests that may be used are :\r\na. Tear stability analysis system.\r\nb. Tear ferning test.\r\nc. Tear function index.\r\nSj\u00f6gren syndrome as a cause of KCS may be excluded by appropriate immunological blood tests and biopsy of labial salivary glands."

A smooth corneal surface prevents its further damage and aggravation of symptoms.\r\nVarious modalities may be :\r\n\r\nAvoiding high room temperature to decrease evaporation of existing tears.\r\nUse of room humidifiers or moist chamber spectacles to reduce evaporation.\r\nContact lenses may be used to protect eyes. These may be of silicone rubber or gas permeable scleral bearing hard contact lenses with or without fenestration or highly gas permeable for overnight wear.\r\nLubricating supplements are the medications most commonly used. Artificial tears are used for mild to moderate KCS. These have short duration of action and therefore requires frequent instillation.\r\nArtificial tears may be of following types :\r\n\r\nCellulose derivatives.\r\nMucomimetics.\r\nPolyvinyl alcohol .\r\n\r\nOther tear substitutes :\r\n\r\nPovidone and sodium chloride.\r\nSodium hyaluronate to promote epithelial healing.\r\n\r\nMineral oil ointment may be used at night time before sleep.\r\n\r\nMucolytic drops e.g. acetylcysteine may be used for corneal filaments and mucous plaques.\r\nAnti-inflammatory agents like topical corticosteroids, topical cyclosporine or topical or systemic omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3 fatty acids inhibit the synthesis of lipid mediators) may be used.\r\nUse of topical or systemic tetracycline.\r\nUse of autologous or umbilical cord serum. Serum eye drops are used in cases of severe KCS with punctate epithelial defects and corneal damage to promote reepithelisation.\r\nUse of systemic immunosuppressants.\r\nPatients with lagophthalmos (incomplete lid closure) may be benefitted with small lateral tarsorrhahy (stitching together of upper and lower lid) to preserve tears.\r\nOcclusion of punctum (punctum is a small hole in lids for drainage of tears from eyes to nose) is useful in severe KCS and also in those showing drug toxicity.\r\nOcclusion of punctum may be :\r\n\r\nTemporary: Punctum may be blocked with plug, silicone rods or even with 2/0 catgut suture. Plugs may be absorbable,nonabsorbable,hydrogel or thermoplastic. Initially, all four puncta are blocked. This is to assess whether blockage leads to tearing or not. Based on the results, permanent occlusion may be planned\r\nPermanent: This is undertaken for severe KCS with Schirmer\u2019s test value consistently being 2mm or less. It is done with gentle heating of proximal canaliculus ( small passage connecting punctum to the lacrimal sac) with cautery at black heat or by Argon laser. Permanent occlusion should be avoided in young patients due to fluctuating tear amount.\r\n\r\n\r\nConjunctival flap may be pulled over to prevent dryness and its complications.\r\nMucous membrane grafting.\r\nAmniotic membrane transplantation may be done.\r\nSalivary gland duct transposition for lubrication.\r\nDescemetocele (thin and bulging cornea), impending or frank perforation may be covered with tissue adhesive cyanoacrylate, corneal or corneoscleral patch."

                "Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) is a tick-borne viral haemorrhagic fever endemic (constant presence of disease) in Karnataka State, India. It is also referred as monkey fever by local people. The virus causing the disease: KFD virus (KFDV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus and family Flaviviridae.\r\nKFDV was first identified in 1957, when an illness occurred in monkeys (the black faced langur and the red faced bonnet monkey) in Kyasanur Forest area of Shimoga district, Karnataka State along with febrile illness and few deaths in humans in neighborhood area (Sagar taluk of Shimoga district).\r\nInitially the disease was limited to three taluks (Sagar, Shikaripur and Sorab) of the Shimoga district of Karnataka. In subsequent years disease spread to Uttar Kannada, Udupi, Mangalore (Dakshina Kannada) and Chikmagalure districts of Karnataka.\r\nDuring 2012-2013, disease was reported from new districts and new states in India: Chamarajanagar district, Karnataka State; Waynad and Malappuram districts, Kerala State and Nilgiri district, Tamilnadu State.\r\nIn 2013, an outbreak of KFD occurred in Bandipur Tiger Reserve Forest, Karnataka. In 2014, Thirthahalli taluk of Shimoga district, Karnataka reported an outbreak. Outbreaks occurred in Pali village of Sattari taluka, and three villages (Mauxi, Zarme and Kopardem) under Community Health Centre (CHC) Valpoi, Northeast Goa in 2015.\r\nEvidences of KFD virus or related viruses were found in different parts of India (parts of the Saurashtra region in Gujarat State, forested regions west of Kolkata, West Bengal State, and the Andaman Islands) during serological studies.\r\nThe increase in number of new foci and cases indicates that ecobiological changes due to deforestation and use of new land for farming and cattle grazing could lead to spread of KFD virus to newer geographical areas.\r\nViruses related to KFDV have been identified in China and Saudi Arabia."

                "KFD is caused by a virus of flavivirus group called KFDV. It is antigenically related to other tick-borne flaviviruses and resembling Russian spring\u2013summer (RSS) complex of viruses.\r\nMode of transmission of KFD virus:\r\nThe virus is transmitted to humans by bite of infected unfed nymphs*(immature stage of tick). Human to human transmission is not known.\r\nNatural hosts and reservoirs- Small mammals particularly rats and squirrels are main reservoir of the virus. Monkeys act as amplifying hosts for the virus and disseminate the infection, but most of them die from KFD infection. Cattle maintain tick population by providing them blood meal but play no part in virus maintenance. Man is incidental or dead end host, and plays no role in viral transmission.\r\nVectors- Hard Ticks of genus Haemaphysalis transmit the disease. Spinigera species of Haemaphysalis is the main vector of KFD and is commonly found in Karnataka State, India. Humans become infected through the bite of infected unfed nymphs when they pass through the forests. Adult ticks feed on large animals like cattle. These large animals are good hosts for proliferation of ticks but are not significant for virus dissemination due to insignificant viremia (presence of virus in blood) in them. Ticks also transmit this virus transstadially (from one life stage to next) thus also acts as reservoir for the virus.\r\n(*Life cycle of hard ticks- Hard ticks have four developmental forms; egg, larva, nymph and adult (female and male). Adult fed female tick lays eggs on the ground, which hatch to larvae under the vegetations. The larvae further infest and feed on small mammals and monkeys, drop on the ground and change into nymphs. Nymphs feed on small mammals, birds, (as well as accidentally infesting humans), drop on the ground and mature in to adults. Adult ticks usually feed and mate on large animals such as cattle, monkeys. Such type of ticks, feeding on three different hosts is called three-host ticks, one each for the larval, nymphal, and adult life stages).\r\nRisk factors-\r\n\r\nPeople with occupational or recreational exposure to rural or outdoor settings (e.g., hunters, herders, forest workers, farmers) are potentially at risk for infection by contact with infected ticks.\r\nIn Karnataka more cases are reported during the dry season, from November to June. This could be correlated with the increased activity of nymphs during November to May in this area."

                "Keratoconus is a non-inflammatory, bilateral (but usually asymmetrical) disease of the cornea which results in progressive corneal steepening. It is characterised by para-central corneal thinning and ectasia so that the cornea takes the shape of a cone. Visual loss occurs primarily from myopia and irregular astigmatism and secondarily from corneal scarring.\r\nDuddell in 1729, described a patient with protruding conical corneas and associated poor vision. Keratoconus was initially broadly defined based on the shape and location of the cone. These included round or nipple cones with a central conical protrusion, and oval cones, often with inferior sagging.\r\nMarc Amsler was the first one to describe early corneal topographic changes in keratoconus patients using keratoscope/ placido disc (ophthalmic instrument for detecting abnormal curvature of the cornea). He categorised keratoconus into clinically recognisable stages as:\r\n\r\nLatent stage: Latent stage was recognisable by placido disc only.\r\nEarly stage: Early stages were subdivided into two categories as:\r\n\r\n\r\n- Keratoconus fruste, which entailed 1- to 4-degree deviation of horizontal axis of the placido disc.\r\n- Early or mild keratoconus, which entailed 5- to 8-degree deviation of horizontal axis.\r\nThe prevalence of keratoconus in general population appears to be relatively high and is likely to be higher when examined with corneal topography (also called photokeratoscopy or videokeratography). Corneal topography is a computer assisted diagnostic tool that creates a three- dimensional map of the surface of the cornea. Keratoconus occurs in all ethnic groups with no male or female preponderance. It is commonly an isolated ocular condition, but sometimes coexists with other ocular and systemic diseases.\r\nCommonly recognised ocular associations include vernal keratoconjunctivitis, retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis; many of the connective tissue disorders (e.g. Ehlers-Danlos and Marfan syndromes), mitral valve prolapse, atopic dermatitis and Down syndrome.\r\nParticular risk factors include atopic history, especially ocular allergies, rigid contact lens wear and vigorous eye rubbing. Most keratoconus cases appear spontaneously, but few may show evidence of genetic transmission.\r\nKeratoconus generally manifests at puberty, and is progressive until third to fourth decade of life when it usually arrests. Sometimes, however, it may commence later in life and progress or arrest at any age."

                "The cause of keratoconus is not known. It may not be a single disorder, but rather a phenotypic expression of perhaps many causes, both genetic and environmental.\r\nThe inheritance pattern of keratoconus is incompletely defined. In the past it was believed that more than 90% of cases were sporadic. With the advent of videokeratography to assess family members, however, pedigrees have been analysed. These studies show corneal changes consistent with keratoconus in some family members, which suggest an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.\r\nKeratoconus may be associated with wide variety of systemic and ocular conditions.\r\nSystemic associations:\r\n\r\nAtopy (a genetic predisposition to develop an allergic reaction): One of the most common associations of keratoconus is atopy and is seen in condition like vernal keratoconjunctivitis. Eye rubbing seen in systemic atopy may play a role in the development of keratoconus.\r\nDown syndrome (Trisomy 21): In Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), frequency of acute hydrops is higher, perhaps because of eye rubbing and/or these patients are treated infrequently with keratoplasty and their disease is allowed to progress further.\r\nEhlers-Danlos syndrome.\r\nMarfan syndrome.\r\nCrouzon syndrome. \r\nApert syndrome.\r\n\r\nOcular associations: \r\n\r\nLeber\u2019s congenital amaurosis.\r\nRetinitis pigmentosa.\r\nRetinopathy of prematurity.\r\nFuchs\u2019 corneal endothelial dystrophy.\r\nPosterior polymorphous dystrophy.\r\n\r\nGiven the relatively high prevalence of keratoconus in general population, some of the associations may be coincidental.\r\n\r\nStudies suggest various contributory factors such as:\r\n\r\nEnzyme abnormalities in corneal epithelium: Enzyme abnormalities such as increased expression of lysosomal enzymes (catalase and cathepsin) and decreased levels of inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes (tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinases), may play a role in corneal stromal degradation.\r\nDifferentially expressed corneal epithelium: Differentially expressed corneal epithelium between keratoconus and myopes (as controls) in both genetic expression and protein expression.\r\nMolecular defect: Molecular defect producing unusual absence of water channel protein aquaporin 5 in keratoconus as compared to normal corneal epithelium.\r\nGelatinolytic activity: Gelatinolytic activity in stroma has been described, which may be due to decreased function of enzyme inhibitors.\r\nAbnormalities in corneal collagen and its cross-linking: Abnormalities in corneal collagen and its cross-linking may be the cause of keratoconus.\r\nEye rubbing: Cytokine has been suggested as a mediator of eye rubbing and stromal degradation. Keratoconus in patients with atopic dermatitis, Down syndrome, and Leber congenital amaurosis, a congenital photoreceptor degeneration, could be related to forceful eye rubbing or the oculodigital reflex. The latter is a behavioural pattern seen in visually and mentally handicapped children who repeatedly strike their eyes with hands.\r\nHard contact lens wear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPathophysiology:\r\nAll layers of the cornea are believed to be affected by keratoconus, although the most notable features are the thinning of the corneal stroma, the fragmentation of the Bowman layer and the deposition of iron in the basal epithelial cells, forming the Fleischer ring. Folds and breaks in the Descemet\u2019s membrane result in acute hydrops and striae, which produces variable amount of diffuse scarring."

                "Refraction, keratometry, corneal topography and slit- lamp (bio-microscopy) examination helps in reaching to the diagnosis of keratoconus.\r\nRefraction: Patients with keratoconus often report blurring/impairment of vision due to progressive myopia and irregular astigmatism. There may be multiple unsatisfactory attempts in obtaining optimum correction with glasses. Spectacles and soft contact lenses may initially give satisfactory vision, but vision tends to decline over time and requires rigid gas-permeable contact lenses for correction.\r\nKeratometry: Images of keratometry mires commonly will be steep, highly astigmatic, irregular, and often appear egg-shaped rather than circular or oval in keratoconus. A value of 47.2 Diopters (D) or greater is suggestive of keratoconus. These signs may be absent in some patients of keratoconus.\r\nCorneal topography/Computerised videokeratography: is helpful in reaching a diagnosis, especially when the typical bio-microscopy signs of Vogt striae and Fleischer ring are absent. Several quantitative indices are available using corneal topography information to screen for keratoconus.\r\nUltrasonic pachymetry: Ultrasonic pachymetry may be useful to confirm corneal thinning in patients with suspected keratoconus on slit- lamp examination or videokeratography. Orbscan corneal topography system and Oculus Pentacam which provides both topography and pachymetry maps are particularly useful in making a diagnosis.\r\nKeratoconus is differentiated according to severity of disease as well as shape of cornea.\r\nShape- based differentiation:\r\nConical shapes of cornea are differentiated as:\r\n\r\nNipple cones: Nipple cones have a diameter of 5mm or less and are located in the center or slightly below the center of the cornea.\r\nOval cones: Oval cones are larger in diameter and are inferonasally or inferotemporally to the center of the cornea.\r\nGlobus cones: Globus cones are large and involve about 75% of the surface of cornea and are least common.\r\n\r\nSeverity- based differentiation:\r\nI. Mild keratoconus:\r\nExternal and corneal signs are often absent or are minimal.\r\n\r\nSpectacle correction: A history of multiple inadequate spectacle corrections of one or both eyes and it may show oblique astigmatism as well as moderate-to-high myopia on refraction.\r\nKeratometry values: Irregularly astigmatic keratometry values, not necessarily on the steep side of normal (approximately 45 Diopters), are consistent with diagnosis.\r\nComputer-assisted videokeratography: Computer-assisted videokeratography may reveal,\r\n\r\n- Inferior corneal steepening (approximately 80% of keratoconus patients),\r\n- Central corneal astigmatic steepening (approximately 15% of keratoconus patients),\r\n- Even bilateral temporal steepening (extremely rare).\r\n\r\nOptical coherence tomography pachymetry (OCT pachymetry): Optical coherence tomography pachymetry shows paraxial corneal thinning.\r\nDiagnostic rigid contact lens: On application of diagnostic rigid contact lens with its base curve equal to the flat keratometry reading after instilling fluorescein sodium dye, a typical nipple pattern is seen in the underlying tear film.\r\nCorneal sensitivity: Corneal sensitivity is reduced.\r\nTear secretions: Tear secretions are decreased.\r\n\r\nII. Moderate keratoconus:\r\n\r\nRetinoscopy: On retinoscopy, there may be distortion of reflex which shows \u2018scissoring reflex\u2019.\r\nCharleaux\u2019s sign: Charleaux oil droplet reflex is a bright reflex from the conical apex surrounded by a dark circular shadow produced by corneal ectasia. Charleaux\u2019s sign or oil drop sign is visualised on observation of the cornea with the pupil dilated using a direct ophthalmoscope set on plano.\r\nMunson sign: Munson sign is the \u2018V\u2019 shape protrusion produced in the lower lid by cornea on down gaze.\r\nRizutti\u2019s sign: Rizutti\u2019s sign is an arrowhead pattern at the nasal limbus being produced by focusing of a light beam shown from temporally across the cornea.\r\nProminent corneal nerves: There may be enhanced appearance of corneal nerves.\r\nVogt striae (fine stress lines): Patients may show Vogt striae (fine stress lines) in the deep stroma. These deep stromal stress lines clear when pressure is applied to the globe.\r\nFleischer ring: Deposition of iron in the basal epithelial cells in a ring shape (often partial) at the base of the conical protrusion, called the Fleischer ring.\r\nCorneal scarring: Corneal scarring may be present at various levels.\r\n\r\n- Superficial corneal scarring, which may be fibular, nebular or nodular.\r\n- Deep stromal scarring perhaps represents resolved mini-hydrops.\r\n- Some patients show scarring at the level of the Descemet membrane, consistent in appearance with posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy. This may be a variant of posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy.\r\n\r\nKeratometry values: Keratometry values are 45- 52 Diopters. There may be pulsation of the reflected images on standard keratometry because thinned cornea readily transmits the ocular pulse.\r\n\r\nSimilar pulsations of the mires on applanation tonometry may be noted.\r\n\r\nOptical coherence tomography pachymetry: Optical coherence tomography pachymetry shows paraxial (usually inferior to the pupil) stromal thinning.\r\n\r\nIII. Advanced keratoconus:\r\n\r\nEnhancement of all corneal sign, symptoms, and visual loss/ distortion, including Vogt striae, Fleischer ring, and/or scarring, is present.\r\nAcute corneal hydrops: Acute corneal hydrops results in acute overhydration of the cornea and accumulation of fluid within the corneal stroma due to acute rupture of Descemet\u2019s membrane. The overlying corneal epithelium may become oedematous, and fluid may leak through the corneal epithelium. The ruptured Descemet\u2019s membrane curls in on itself, and over time endothelial cells spread over the posterior stromal defect.\r\nKeratometry: Keratometry values are greater than 52 Diopters.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrading keratoconus:\r\nSeveral quantitative indices are available using corneal topography information to screen for keratoconic corneal shape factors. The two most commonly known indices are those of Rabinowitz and Maeda and Klyce.\r\nI. Rabinowitz index: Rabinowitz created KISA% index, which provides an algorithm to quantify results from computerised videokeratoscopy. The KISA% index uses:\r\n\r\nThe corneal central keratometry (K value) value, which indicates central corneal steepening.\r\nThe inferior- superior dioptric asymmetry (I- S) value\r\nThe keratometric astigmatism (AST) index, which quantifies the degree of regular corneal astigmatism based on (SimK1- SimK2). Simulated keratometry (SimK) index provides information on the diopteric power of the flattest and most curved meridians. Numerically, it is expressed as K1 and K2, and the difference (SimK1- SimK2) between the two values provides a quantitative value of corneal astigmatism.\r\nThe skewed radial axis (SRAX) value: Skew of steepest radial axis measures the angle between the more curved superior semi- meridian and the more curved inferior semi- meridian.\r\n\r\n\r\nRabinowitz diagnostic criteria consist of three corneal topography derived indices, which, when abnormal in value, should alert the clinician to consider a diagnosis of keratoconus. These indices are:\r\n\r\n\r\nK value (Central keratometry) quantifies the central steepening of the cornea that occurs in keratoconus. A value of 47.20 D or greater is suggestive of keratoconus.\r\nI-S value (inferior- superior value) quantifies the inferior versus superior corneal diopteric asymmetry that occurs in keratoconus. A positive value indicates higher inferior curvature while a negative value indicates higher superior curvature. I-S values between 1.4D and 1.8D are defined as cut- off points for suspected keratoconus. I-S values higher than 1.8D are defined as cut- off points for clinical keratoconus.\r\nKISA% incorporates the K, I-S values, SRAX and AST with a measure quantifying regular and irregular astigmatism into one index. This index is highly sensitive and specific in separating normal from keratoconic corneas. A value of greater than 100% is highly suggestive of keratoconus, and the range from 60 to 100% represents suspected keratoconus.\r\n\r\nII. Maeda and Klyce computer expert program: Maeda and Klyce designed a computer expert program, based on linear discriminant analysis of 8 indices drawn from the corneal map and a binary decision tree. The program assigns the topographical map a quantitative percentage score of the severity of keratoconus called the keratoconus index% (KCI%). A value of greater than zero is believed to be suggestive of keratoconus.\r\nIII. McMahon and colleague keratoconus severity score (KSS): McMahon and colleagues and the Collaborative Longitudinal Evaluation of Keratoconus (CLEK) study, have proposed a method called the keratoconus severity score (KSS) for grading the severity of keratoconus. The KSS score utilises:\r\n\r\nClinical signs (Vogt\u2019s striae, Fleischer ring, corneal scarring).\r\nTwo corneal topography indices (average corneal power and the root mean square (RMS) error for higher- order aberrations).\r\nManual interpretation of the topography map to form a 1-to-5 grading system.\r\n\r\nAdvantages of KSS score:\r\n\r\nKSS system provides good reproducibility.\r\nIt is not limited to the use of one topographer.\r\nUnlike KISA% index, it grades the severity of keratoconus rather than just identifying presence or absence of the condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistopathology:\r\nAll layers of the cornea are affected by keratoconus. Keratoconus shows irregular epithelium, breaks in Bowman\u2019s layer, and fibrosis filling in the breaks that extend beneath the epithelium. Iron deposition in the basal corneal epithelial cells forms the characteristic Fleischer ring. With hydrops, breaks at the layer of Descemet\u2019s membrane are seen, with inward curling of Descemet\u2019s membrane, which is otherwise normal. Some studies have reported endothelial cell loss in association with the rupture of the Descemet\u2019s membrane.\r\n\r\nElectron microscopy shows decreased thickness of the cornea with fewer lamellae. The collagen fibrils in the lamellae are thickened mildly and the space between fibrils is increased.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis:\r\nKeratoconus should be distinguished from other ectatic and thinning disorders such as:\r\n\r\nPellucid marginal degeneration.\r\nTerrien\u2019s marginal degeneration.\r\nKeratoglobus.\r\nPost-traumatic corneal ectasia.\r\nProtrusion of cornea subsequent to corneal thinning from ulceration.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distinction can usually be made by slit- lamp (bio-microscopy) examination and corneal topography."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nMedical therapy:\r\n\r\nSpectacle correction: Initially, attempt should be made to correct myopic astigmatism by prescribing spectacle correction. Early keratoconus patients may get satisfactory vision with spectacles. Development of irregular astigmatism often limits the use of spectacle correction, and patients may require contact lenses.\r\nRigid gas- permeable (RGP) contact lenses: Rigid gas- permeable (RGP) contact lenses are often the first lenses of choice and may be prescribed once spectacle-corrected acuity becomes inadequate. Other lenses used are piggyback lenses, pure hydro gel lenses, multi curve or aspheric contact lenses. Contact lens wear often is complicated by episodes of intolerance, allergic reactions (e.g. giant papillary conjunctivitis), corneal abrasions, neovascularisation, sometimes leading to total intolerance. Though contact lenses are extremely useful, it may increase the risk of corneal scarring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy: \r\nSurgical therapy may be resorted to when patient does not improve with the use of contact lenses.\r\nContact lenses may fail due to:\r\n\r\nInadequate acuity.\r\nInadequate lens tolerance.\r\nFrequent lens displacements.\r\nPeripheral thinning.\r\n\r\nSurgical procedures:\r\n\r\nKeratoplasty: Standard surgical treatment consists of keratoplasty. Recurrence of keratoconus after keratoplasty is rare. Recurrence may be due to:\r\n\r\n- Incomplete excision of the cone at the time of surgery.\r\n- Unrecognised keratoconus in the corneal donor.\r\n- Host cellular activity that causes changes in the donor corneal material.\r\nLamellar keratoplasty: Lamellar keratoplasty is effective, but this is not preferred because of the technical difficulties in the procedure and slightly reduced visual outcome.\r\nEpikeratoplasty: Epikeratoplasty has been successful as well, but it has been abandoned due to suboptimal visual outcome.\r\nPenetrating keratoplasty: By far the most frequent procedure is penetrating keratoplasty. At the time of keratoplasty, decreasing the donor/ recipient size disparity reduces post-keratoplasty myopia. Complications of penetrating keratoplasty include corneal graft rejection, glaucoma, cataract formation, anisometropia, astigmatism and infection.\r\nDeep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK): Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) has been proposed as an alternative to penetrating keratoplasty. Recent advances in surgical technique have generated interest in DALK. Primary advantages are:\r\n- Increased structural integrity.\r\n- Reduced risk of graft rejection.\r\nWhile challenging to perform, innovative techniques such as the big-bubble technique have reduced surgical operating time, improved the safety of the procedure, and gives visual outcome similar to penetrating keratoplasty. Complications of DALK include graft- host interface haze, Descemet\u2019s membrane perforation and stromal rejection.\r\n\r\nIntra-corneal ring segments: Intra-corneal ring segments have achieved some success in patients without corneal scarring in reducing the myopia and astigmatism and improving spectacle- corrected visual acuity. INTACS (Addition Technology, Fermont, CA) are intrastromal corneal ring segments, placed in the peripheral cornea, either mechanically or with the femtosecond laser.\r\nCombined riboflavin-ultraviolet type A rays (UVA) collagen cross-linking: Combined riboflavin-ultraviolet type A rays (UVA) collagen cross-linking consists of photo-polymerisation of corneal stroma by combining vitamin B2 (photosensitising substance) with UVA. This process increases rigidity of corneal collagen and thus reduces the likelihood of further ectasia.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nKeratoconus, though progressive initially, stabilises after some time in most of the patient. Most patients with keratoconus do well with rigid contact lenses.\r\nKeratoplasty may be required when patients do not improve with contact lenses.\r\nFortunately, patients with keratoconus never become totally blind."

                "Keratoglobus is a rare non-inflammatory corneal thinning disorder characterised by generalised thinning and globular ectasis (protrusion) of the cornea. The non-inflammatory corneal ectasias are a group of disorders characterised by corneal thinning, protrusion, and scarring. Keratoglobus forms a rarer subset of this group. \r\nKeratoglobus was first described as a separate clinical entity by Verrey in 1947, through detailed descriptions of his patients. In the past, it was considered synonymous with megalocornea and congenital glaucoma.\r\nThe exact genetics and pathogenesis of this disorder is still not clear. There are similarities with other non-inflammatory thinning disorder like keratoconus, which gave rise to hypothesis about the aetiopathogenesis.\r\nKeratoglobus and keratoconus are both non-inflammatory ectatic disorders of the cornea. Cavara in 1950 made distinction between keratoglobus and keratoconus. The cornea in keratoglobus is diffusely thinned, often more markedly in the peripheral cornea, whereas in keratoconus the thinning is most prominent in the central cornea. The histopathological changes seen in keratoglobus, including disruption of Bowman's layer and Descemet's membrane breaks, are very similar to those seen in advanced keratoconus. These similarities have brought about confusion as to whether the disorders comprising this group are separate clinical disorders, or rather a spectrum of the same disease process. In fact, the histological similarities have led to the speculation that keratoglobus may be an end-stage manifestation of advanced keratoconus.\r\nClinical presentation is characterised by progressive diminution of vision resulting from irregular corneal topography with increased corneal fragility due to extreme thinning. Conservative and surgical management for visual rehabilitation and improved tectonic (structural) stability have been described, but are challenging. In the absence of a definitive standard procedure for management of this disorder, various surgical procedures have been attempted in order to overcome the difficulties.\r\nBoth congenital and acquired forms have been shown to occur, and may be associated with various other ocular and systemic syndromes including the connective tissue disorders.\r\nCongenital form is present at birth and is associated with:\r\n\r\nEhlers- Danlos syndrome type VI.\r\nBlue sclera syndrome.\r\nLeber\u2019s congenital amaurosis.\r\n\r\nAcquired form presents in adulthood and may evolve from pre-existing cases of keratoconus or pellucid marginal degeneration.

The congenital form of the disorder is always bilateral. The exact genetics of the disorder have not been studied in detail and no definite inheritance pattern has been described. It is assumed to be autosomal recessive.\r\n\r\n      It has also been associated with:\r\n\r\n- Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome type VI: Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome type VI is distinct for its ocular manifestations. These include corneal abnormalities of cornea plana, keratoconus and keratoglobus, blue sclera, and ocular fragility. Other systemic features in this type are the presence of hypermobile joints, skeletal abnormalities like scoliosis, pectus excavatum, a marfanoid habitus, and hearing loss. Skin laxity and fragility is not a characteristic finding, unlike in other types of Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndromes, and lysyl hydroxylase activity may be normal.\r\n- Marfan syndrome.\r\n- Rubinstein\u2013Taybi syndrome.\r\n- Blue sclera syndromes: Blue sclera syndromes may be the manifestation of syndromes like Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome type VI or osteogenesis imperfecta.\r\n- Leber\u2019s congenital amaurosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquired: In recent years, there have been reports of acquired forms of keratoglobus.

Overlaps in aetiological factors between keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration, and keratoglobus, such as their manifestations in connective tissue disorders and various acquired forms leads to speculation about their being different spectrums of the same disease.

                "The diagnosis of keratoglobus is essentially clinical, owing to the characteristic clinical findings. In less severe cases, there may be difficulty in differentiating the condition from other ectatic conditions.\r\nKeratoglobus, a bilateral ectatic disorder of the cornea, is characterised by a globular protrusion of the cornea associated with diffuse thinning from limbus to limbus. The age of onset is at birth.\r\nPatients usually present with stable or worsening bilateral visual impairment which may not be corrected with spectacles or contact lenses. Rarely, patient may present with acute pain in eyes due to acute hydrops.\r\nClinical diagnosis is made by slit lamp examination (bio-microscopy) of the eye.\r\nClinical features:\r\n\r\nIrregular retinoscopic reflex.\r\nMyopia or high myopia.\r\nIrregular astigmatism.\r\nGlobular protrusion of cornea.\r\nDiffuse corneal thinning, most severe in peripheral part and may be up to one- fifth of the normal corneal thickness.\r\nFolds, breaks, or thickening of Descemet\u2019s membrane.\r\nSpontaneous rupture or tear of Descemet\u2019s membrane.\r\nClear cornea unless there are episodes of acute hydrops and scarring.\r\nNormal corneal diameter, which distinguishes it from buphthalmos.\r\nVogt striae and Fleischer\u2019s rings are not associated, unlike keratoconus.\r\n\r\n\r\nInvestigational procedures:\r\n\r\nCorneal topography or videokeratography: Corneal topography or videokeratography show diffuse thinning.\r\nUltrasonic pachymetry: Ultrasonic pachymetry shows reduced corneal thickness.\r\nAnterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS- OCT).\r\nScheimpflug analysis: A Scheimpflug system images the anterior segment by creating an optical section of the cornea. Topography and pachymetry of the cornea is calculated and displayed which shows generalised thinning.\r\n\r\n\r\nSystemic examination may show features of blue sclera, skeletal abnormalities, hyper-mobility of joints, hearing loss, abnormal dentition or high-arched palate. There may be features specific to each syndrome. It has been seen in few cases that keratoglobus in association with blue sclera syndromes is more probable to undergo spontaneous perforation or after minimal trauma, and hence the name \u2018brittle cornea\u2019 is used.\r\n\r\nHistopathology:\r\nThere are frequent disruptions or complete absence of Bowman\u2019s layer, stromal thinning and disorganisation, and breaks or thickening of Descemet\u2019s membrane. Acquired type of keratoglobus is characterised by an essentially normal Bowman\u2019s layer that undergoes focal breaks with superficial stromal ectasia secondary to other corneal pathology.\r\nImmunohistochemical studies: There are limited immunohistochemical studies in cases of keratoglobus. Meghpara et al. (2009) found decreased expression of proteinase inhibitor alpha-1-PI, and increased expression of the transcription factor Sp1 in the corneal epithelial cells. They found increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1, 2, and 3 within the epithelial cells. The MMPs are responsible for degradation of some component of the extracellular matrix. Increased Sp1 and MMP 1, 2, and 3 was found diffusely throughout the cornea, but maximally at the mid-periphery and corresponded to areas of underlying Bowman\u2019s layer disruptions. The increased expression of pro-degradation products and decreased expression of inhibitory substances is most probably a key pathogenic factor in causing ectasia.\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis:\r\n\r\nKeratoconus: Keratoconus develops around puberty and may progress until 40\u201350 years of age, whereas keratoglobus presents at birth. Keratoglobus is considered a non-progressive or minimally progressive disorder. The corneal thinning in keratoconus is most commonly seen in the inferior paracentral aspect of the cornea. The protrusion is commonly described as conical in shape, with maximal thinning at the apex. Keratoglobus presents with diffuse thinning and a globular protrusion. Keratoconus shows scarring, Vogt\u2019s striae and Fleischer\u2019s ring.\r\nPellucid marginal degeneration: Pellucid marginal degeneration presents around 20\u201340 years of age. Thinning involves the inferior aspect of cornea, as a band of 1\u20132\u2009mm width and extending from 4 to 8 o\u2019clock position. Protrusion occur superior to this area of thinning, leading to characteristic topographical patterns. Scarring and hydrops may also occur as well.\r\nCongenital glaucoma: Congenital glaucoma may show moderate protrusion of the cornea, hydrops, and mild astigmatism with myopia. Hallmark of Congenital glaucoma is raised intraocular pressure and possible glaucomatous optic nerve changes that would be absent in the case of keratoglobus. There is no corneal thinning and corneal diameters may be increased. In congenital glaucoma, the myopia would result primarily from the increased anterior and posterior axial length, whereas in keratoglobus it would be mainly because of the increased corneal curvature.\r\nMegalocornea: In megalocornea, the main differentiating feature is the increased corneal diameter (usually over 12.5\u2009mm) with absence of any corneal thinning. This is in contrast to keratoglobus where corneal diameters are normal and there is profound, diffuse thinning. There is therefore an absence of any corneal protrusion, astigmatism, hydrops, or scarring in cases of megalocornea.\r\nCorneal ectasia following refractive surgery."

Enforcement of use of protective glasses is difficult in children, making them susceptible to injury.\r\n\r\nMedical therapy:\r\n\r\nSpectacle correction: High myopia may be corrected with spectacles, but is limited by high irregular astigmatism.\r\nContact lenses: Use of contact lenses is still a matter of debate because of the theoretical risk of perforation on contact lens insertion and removal over corneas that are known to perforate on even trivial trauma. The extreme protrusion and irregularity makes fitting complicated, with a need for balance between optical improvement and lens stability. Customised fitting of scleral lenses, small diameter rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses, reverse geometry hydrogel lenses, as well as large diameter inverse geometry RGP lenses have been described for corneal ectasias.\r\n\r\nConventional treatment of acute hydrops is nonspecific, and involves the use of patching, bandage contact lens, topical hypertonic saline, and cycloplegics to reduce the oedema. In recent years intra-cameral (in anterior chamber of eye) gas has been tried for acute hydrops.\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\nSurgically, there is no known standard procedure for management of the condition owing to its rarity. Individual procedures have their own advantages and disadvantages.\r\n\r\nRepair of perforations: Repair of perforations commonly resulted in poor outcomes because of the nature of the perforations that are usually large, and owing to the fragility of the thinned cornea that prevented stable placement of sutures that would cut through or \u2018cheese-wire\u2019.\r\nPenetrating keratoplasty: Penetrating keratoplasty in keratoglobus is also not possible because of the thinned cornea and peripheral graft\u2013host thickness disparity that prevents adequate wound closure. Patients also are left with extreme irregular astigmatism and ultimately poor visual outcome. Large limbus to limbus donor corneal grafts have been tried to avoid placement of the graft\u2013host junction at the thinned mid-periphery, thereby creating better stability.\r\nPentacam- based deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK): In deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK), the anterior third to two-thirds of the cornea is replaced with donor tissue. Use of pentacam provides a three-dimensional image or thickness profile of the entire cornea preoperatively.\r\nCorneoscleroplasty: Corneoscleroplasty involves a central full thickness penetrating keratoplasty with a lamellar peripheral corneoscleral dissection from the edge of the full thickness keratoplasty.\r\nEpikeratoplasty: Epikeratoplasty is a rare form of surgery. This is a type of on-lay lamellar keratoplasty in which a lens made of human corneal tissue is sutured onto the anterior surface of the cornea to change its anterior curvature and refraction.\r\n\u2018Tuck-in\u2019 lamellar keratoplasty: \u2018Tuck-in\u2019 lamellar keratoplasty refers to a central lamellar keratoplasty with intrastromal tucking of the peripheral flange.\r\nCorneoscleral rim: Corneoscleral rim is a temporary measure to provide tectonic stability over thinned corneal periphery. It slows progression of mid- peripheral thinning and delays further surgical intervention.\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nThe prognosis for keratoglobus is poor. Spectacle correction often results in sub-optimal \u2018best corrected visual acuity\u2019 (BCVA).\r\nSurgical correction may be associated with complications."

                "Diagnosis and treatment of Kala-Azar are problematic because of a variety of reasons. While treatment is lengthy and relatively costly, definitive diagnosis of Kala-Azar requires tissue specimens, which are conventionally obtained by organ needle aspiration for microscopic demonstration of amastigote forms in stained smears. Bone marrow the spleen, and lymph-node (in some regions) are the tissues most often sampled in patients with suspected infection. The diagnostic sensitivity of splenic aspiration is high (95% - 98%), but the procedure carries a risk of bleeding; the sensitivity of examination of bone marrow specimens is considered to be lower (53% - 95%). Organ aspiration and accurate examination of smears also require technical skills that are not uniformly available in rural areas.

                "Ligneous conjunctivitis (LC) is a rare, potentially sight and even life-threatening (e.g. by airway obstruction) disorder characterised by recurrent, often bilateral fibrin-rich pseudo-membranous lesions of wood-like consistency that develop mainly on the tarsal conjunctiva. It is the main clinical manifestation of systemic plasminogen deficiency and typically presents in childhood. There appears to be a higher incidence in females as compared to males. With plasminogen deficiency, wound-healing capability is diminished and is most pronounced in mucous membranes, such as conjunctiva. Plasminogen is converted to plasmin by plasminogen activators in the blood. Plasmin is a serine protease and is the predominant fibrinolytic enzyme in the human circulation, and is also found in the extracellular matrix. Plasmin plays an important role in haemostasis, as well as, is an integral component of wound healing (acts by degrading fibrin). Due to plasminogen deficiency, fibrin rich membranes or mucous strands accumulate, which on desiccation of the fibrin leads to the ligneous consistency of the conjunctival lesions. Episodes may be triggered by relatively minor trauma, surgery (done particularly for pterygium or pinguecula) or by systemic events such as fever and anti-fibrinolytic therapy. Similar mechanisms occur in extra-ocular manifestations of plasminogen deficiency.\r\nBouisson in 1847 first described a man with bilateral pseudo-membranous conjunctivitis (Bouisson M. Ophthalmic sur-aigue avec formation de pseudo-membranes a la surface de la conjonctive. Ann Ocul, 1847; 17: 100-4). In 1933, the term \u2018ligneous\u2019, meaning \u2018woody\u2019 was introduced by Borel to describe the characteristic wood-like consistency of the pseudo-membranes (Borel MG. Un nouveau syndrome palpebral. Bull Soc Fr Ophthalmol 1933; 46: 168-80). However, the link between LC and plasminogen deficiency was established in 1997 by Mingers et al (Mingers AM, Heimburger N, Zeitler P, et al. Homozygous type I plasminogen deficiency. Semin Thromb Hemost 1997; 23:259-69). As many patients develop similar pseudo-membranes in other mucous membranes of the body, Mingers et al. suggested the term \u2018pseudo-membranous disease\u2019 to describe the systemic nature of this disease. Although the lesions have been referred to as pseudo-membranous (a pseudo-membrane consists of a loose fibrin-cellular debris exudates not adherent to the underlying epithelium, from which it can be easily stripped, usually without bleeding) in the literature, the lesions are actually true membranes (a true membrane consists of an exudate of fibrin-cellular debris firmly attached to the underlying epithelium by fibrin. On attempted removal, the epithelium is stripped off and leaves a raw bleeding surface).\r\nLC is rare, and the prevalence of this disorder has not been firmly established. LC can occur in older individuals, despite it being classically associated with infants and children.\r\nLess frequently, LC may lead to similar membrane formation in mucous membranes of other organs, such as:\r\n\r\nOral cavity (ligneous gingivitis).\r\nGastrointestinal tracts.\r\nUpper and lower respiratory tracts (sinus, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs).\r\nEars.\r\nFemale genital tracts.\r\nRenal collecting system.\r\n\r\nRarely, it may also cause:\r\n\r\nJuvenile colloid milium of the skin.\r\nOcclusive hydrocephalus.\r\n\r\nSeveral studies have shown extra-ocular manifestations of severe plasminogen deficiency even without ocular involvement.\r\nHistopathological findings indicate that impaired wound healing, mainly of injured mucosal tissue, is due to markedly decreased, plasmin-mediated extracellular fibrinolysis.\r\nLC is characterised by multiple recurrences after local excision, and management involves the adjunctive use of topical and systemic replacement of plasminogen."

                "There is evidence to support that ligneous conjunctivitis is the result of plasminogen deficiency.\r\nThere are two types of plasminogen deficiency:\r\n\r\nType I (hypo-plasminogenaemia) is a quantitative deficiency.\r\nType II (dys-plasminogenaemia) is a qualitative deficiency.\r\n\r\nType I deficiency is the type most associated with LC.\r\nWith plasminogen deficiency, wound-healing capability is diminished and is most pronounced in mucous membranes, such as the conjunctiva. The impaired wound healing capacity causes an arrest of granulation tissue formation and excessive fibrin deposition. Thus, fibrin rich membranes or mucous strands accumulate, stimulating inflammatory cells and fibroblasts, while desiccation of the fibrin leads to the ligneous consistency of the conjunctival lesions. Similar patho-physiologic mechanisms occur in extra-ocular manifestations of plasminogen deficiency.\r\nWhile in extra-vascular spaces, fibrinolysis, with low to non-existent levels of plasminogen activity, is impaired. However, in vessels this is not the case, as can be inferred from the fact that thrombotic phenomena is absent in patients with LC and plasminogen deficiency. It has been suggested that non-plasmin induced fibrinolysis is intensified in patients with plasminogen deficiency and ligneous conjunctivitis.\r\nGenetics of disease:\r\nGenetics of the disease allows for prenatal diagnosis in known carrier families, which may be crucial in cases of obstructive congenital hydrocephalous.\r\nDevelopment of ligneous lesions is caused by:\r\n\r\n\r\nSporadic mutations in plasminogen gene. This is the most common cause. The gene for plasminogen is located on chromosome 6, and is produced predominantly by the liver.\r\nCompound-heterozygous mutations.\r\nHomozygous mutations.\r\nTissue injury:\r\nDue to the appearance, histopathology, clinical course, and response to treatment, it is also believed that LC results from an exaggerated inflammatory response to tissue injury. This injury may arise from infection or physical trauma, including surgery. These factors may incite a genetic predisposition, such as plasminogen deficiency, to develop this response. Schuster and Seregard also postulated that conjunctivitis is the most common manifestation of plasminogen deficiency, due to frequent exposure to ocular irritants (Schuster V, Seregard S. Ligneous Conjunctivitis. Surv Ophthalmol 2003; 48: 369-88). These irritants may start or perpetuate local inflammation and create ligneous membranes.\r\nMany cases of antecedent viral or bacterial infections have been described, including staphylococcal, streptococcal, and haemophilus conjunctivitis. In these cases, it appears that LC, in genetically susceptible individuals, develops as an abnormal response to the conjunctival trauma elicited by the infecting organisms.\r\nTrauma, especially from surgery, is also thought to be a cause of LC. LC appears to develop as an abnormal response of the immune system to the conjunctival trauma."

                "The diagnosis of LC is based on the clinical picture (ocular and/or extra-ocular membranous lesions), the typical histological findings, and a possible positive family history. In most patients with LC, hypo-plasminogenaemia may be found.\r\nIf the responsible mutation has been identified in an affected family, then prenatal diagnosis of children at risk is possible.\r\nOcular Features:\r\nExamination of eyes should be carried out under slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) by an eye-specialist.\r\nPatients typically present with chronic conjunctivitis. Discharge or membranes are not seen in the early stages.\r\nConjunctival ligneous lesions: The earliest true ligneous lesion appears as a highly vascularised, raised, friable lesion. It may be covered by a thick yellow-white mucoid discharge. This lesion can be removed easily with forceps, although it tends to bleed on removal. With continued inflammation, a white, thickened, avascular mass appears above the neo-vascular membrane. Attempts at removal of this lesion often results in recurrence of the lesion to its original size within days. These lesions are most often seen on the palpebral conjunctiva of the upper and lower eyelids but may also be found on the bulbar conjunctiva, including the limbus. Bulbar conjunctival involvement may occur either de novo or from extension of a palpebral lesion. Despite appropriate therapy, inflammation may continue, and the chronic lesions become thickened, vascularised, and firm, giving rise to the name \u2018ligneous\u2019 meaning woody.\r\nCorneal lesions: Limbal lesions may extend over the surface of the cornea and may lead to corneal:\r\n\r\nNeovascularisation.\r\nScarring.\r\nInfection.\r\nMelting.\r\n\r\nSystemic Features:\r\nFever or infections of the upper respiratory tract, urinary tract, or female genital tract, may either precede or concomitantly occur with LC, or might even act as a trigger for the development of membranes.\r\nOro-pharynx:\r\nMembranous lesions may cause:\r\n\r\nLoss of dental integrity.\r\nPainless nodular ulcers.\r\nGingival hyperplasia.\r\n\r\nEars:\r\nMembranous lesions may occur on:\r\n\r\nTympanic membrane.\r\nMiddle ear causing otitis media.\r\n\r\nRespiratory Tract:\r\nLigneous lesions may involve:\r\n\r\nLarynx.\r\nVocal cords.\r\nTrachea.\r\nBronchial tree.\r\n\r\nGenitourinary Tract:\r\nLigneous lesions in female genital tract may involve:\r\n\r\nCervix causing ligneous cervicitis.\r\nVagina.\r\nFallopian tubes.\r\nOvary.\r\nEndometrium.\r\n\r\nJuvenile Colloid Milium:\r\nThis is a rare skin condition characterised by the development of small, yellow-brown, translucent papules, typically in sun-exposed areas of the skin. It tends to occur prior to puberty.\r\nCongenital Occlusive Hydrocephalus:\r\nLC patients are also reported to suffer from congenital occlusive hydrocephalus.\r\nLaboratory diagnosis:\r\n\r\nAbnormality of plasminogen activity and/or antigen: Laboratory analysis confirms disorder with an abnormality of plasminogen activity and/or antigen. Since ligneous lesions are most commonly seen in type I plasminogen deficiency, the antigen test alone is insufficient to rule out this disease.\r\nPrenatal testing: Prenatal testing to identify genetic mutations may be conducted to identify this disease.\r\n\r\nHistopathological/ Immuno-histochemical evaluation:\r\nHistological examination of ligneous membranes shows superficial or sub-epithelial deposits of eosinophilic amorphous hyaline, amyloid-like material with a variable proportion of granulation tissue with accompanying inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells and granulocytes). This amorphous hyaline material contains mainly fibrin and other plasma proteins, such as albumin and immune-globulins (mainly IgG). Ligneous lesions may also contain variable amounts of muco-polysaccharides in adjacent granulation tissue. Abnormal vascular permeability has also been suggested as the source of various components of the ligneous lesions. Melikian postulated that a sero-fibrinous transudate from the conjunctival neovascularisation undergoes subsequent coagulation, with the resulting formation of granulation tissue and accumulation of the hyaline material, which becomes hardened and form ligneous membranes. (Melikian H E. Treatment of ligneous conjunctivitis. Ann Ophthalmol 1985; 17: 763-65)\r\nImmuno-histochemical evaluation of LC lesions showed a cellular infiltrate that was composed mainly of T lymphocytes. Immuno-fluorescent techniques demonstrated that the major components of the hyaline material in the substantia propria were immune-globulins (mainly IgG).\r\nTopical cyclosporine A has been reported to be more effective than other topical agents (short of plasminogen preparations) in the treatment of this disorder. Cyclosporine A prevents the activation and recruitment of the T-cell response. Finally, a decrease in the number of B lymphocytes and plasma cells occur. These results indicate the local effect of cyclosporine A on the immune-response. The clinical response and histopathological confirmation of the effect of Cyclosporine A further support the inflammatory nature of this disease.\r\nLigneous conjunctivitis should be differentiated from:\r\nAny inflammatory or infectious disease which can cause a chronic pseudo-membranous conjunctivitis, such as:\r\n\r\nViral conjunctivitis:\r\n\r\nHerpes simplex infection.\r\nEpidemic keratoconjunctivitis.\r\nMolluscum contagiosum.\r\n\r\nBacterial conjunctivitis:\r\n\r\nStaphylococcus aureus.\r\nStreptococcus haemolyticus.\r\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae.\r\nChlamydia trachomatis.\r\nCorynebacterium diphtheriae.\r\n\r\nAllergic conjunctivitis:\r\n\r\nVernal keratoconjunctivitis.\r\n\r\nToxic conjunctivitis:\r\nChemical conjunctivitis:\r\n\r\nAcid.\r\nAlkali.\r\n\r\nStevens-Johnson syndrome.\r\nAmyloidosis."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nManagement of LC tends to be unsatisfactory and spontaneous resolution is rare.\r\nIt is important to discontinue any anti-fibrinolytic therapy.\r\nMedical therapy:\r\n\r\n\r\nPlasminogen substitution: Systemic and topical plasminogen substitution or Fresh Frogen Plasma (FFP) is presently being investigated as the primary treatment for ligneous conjunctivitis. Mingers et al. first proposed the theory of plasminogen deficiency and attempted supplementing plasminogen. Topical plasminogen preparations, extracted from fresh frozen plasma, have successfully been used in the treatment of LC. Using FFP bypasses, the need for plasminogen concentrate alone, which has a very short half-life and is difficult to have it readily available.\r\n\r\nCyclosporine A: Cyclosporine A had been the most promising element in the therapeutic management before plasminogen. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther measures: Based on the early observations of the presence of granulation tissue and inflammatory cells in ligneous tissue, topical medical regimens toward these non-specific findings were developed. Topical therapy including, topical hyaluronidase, heparin, azathioprine, alpha-chymotrypsin, sodium cromoglycate, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and fibrinolysin have shown limited success.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\nBecause trauma to the conjunctiva is likely to be an aetiological factor in LC, conjunctival surgery must be performed with utmost care.\r\n\r\n\r\nExcision of ligneous lesions: Systemic and topical plasminogen or FFP treatment is started to help soften the pseudo-membrane and facilitate removal. Complete excision with diathermy of the base of all ocular ligneous lesions is done. General anaesthesia may be used in adults with significant disease, and in all children. Failure to completely remove the lesion results in rapid recurrence, because the retained lesion acts as physical barrier to topical medical treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after surgery, the patient is continued on systemic and topical FFP, and started on a corticosteroid, broad-spectrum antibiotic and topical cyclosporine A. These medications are given after surgery, as early recurrence is the hallmark of this disorder.\r\n\r\nA small but significant amount of recurrence will be seen daily in every patient, and every recurrent lesion must be debrided daily. If abnormal tissue is allowed to collect for even 1 to 2 days, it will act as a barrier and prevent the topical medications from reaching the basal tissue, which is the origin of ligneous membranes.\r\n\r\nRepeat excision is conducted for the recurrent lesions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmniotic membrane transplantation: Barbino and Rolando performed amniotic membrane transplantation for conjunctival reconstruction of LC. (Barabino S, Rolando M. Amniotic membrane transplantation in a case of ligneous conjunctivitis. Am J Ophthalmol 2004; 137: 752-753)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSurgical intervention may be needed to relieve obstruction in patients with congenital occlusive hydrocephalus.\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nThe prognosis for ligneous conjunctivitis is variable and is based upon the extent, length and the affected site producing symptoms. It depends on the ability to control inflammation and recurrence of pseudo-membranes. Patients with corneal involvement have poorer visual prognosis.\r\nMany patients have lived into adulthood. Many patients experienced significant morbidity, including loss of function of an affected organ, such as loss of sight or loss of dentition.\r\nSystemic involvement of respiratory tract (tracheo-bronchial lesions) with pseudo-membranes may be life threatening due to respiratory failure. This group of patients are in need of specific therapy that treat and prevent these lesions and the sequelae thereof.\r\nThe quality of life of untreated patients with significant disease is not optimal."

                "Visionis the special sense by which the qualities of an object (as colour, luminosity, shape, and size) constituting its appearance are perceived through a process in which light rays entering the eye are transformed by the retina(light sensitive inner layer of eyeball) into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve .\r\nVisual acuityis a measure of resolution of the visual processing system. It is measured commonly with an eye chart e.g. Snellen chart. A common Snellen chart is printed with eleven lines of block letters. In visual acuity testing on Snellen chart, person normally sits at a distance of 6 meters from the chart on which letters of standard decreasing size are there in rows. Top line has a single letter which should be readable at a distance of 60 meters. Visual acuity is recorded as a ratio with numerator of 6 (distance at which patient sits.) and the denominator of the smallest possible size being read by the patient. For example, a vision record of 6/60 means that patient sitting at 6 meters could read letter in top line only , which should normally be read at 60 meters. Instead of distances being in meters, it may also be measured in feet. 6 meters is about 20 feet. Therefore, a vision of 6/6 in meters, is equivalent to a vision of 20/20 in feet. Similarly, a vision of 6/60 in meters, is equal to 20/200 in feet.\r\nTypical Snellen chart to estimate visual acuity:Image in Wikipedia(link is external)  \r\nLow visionwas defined as \u2018Visual acuity of 6/18 down to and including 3/60 in the better eye\u2019. A person with low vision is \u2018someone who, after medical, surgical and/or optical intervention, has a corrected visual acuity in the better eye of &lt;6/18 down to and including light perception or a central visual field of &lt;20 degrees, but who uses or has the potential to use vision for the planning and/or execution of a task.\u2019 Thus, Low vision is a reduced level of vision that cannot be fully corrected with conventional glasses. In 10threvision of the International classification of the diseases (ICD-10 version: 2015), the term low vision is replaced by terms\u2018moderatevisual impairment(presenting visual acuity of &lt;6/18 to 6/60)\u2019 and\u2018severe visualimpairment(presenting visual acuity of &lt;6/60 to 3/60)\u2019, from all causes.\r\n\u2018 Vision 2020: the Right to Sight\u2019 is a partnership between World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Agency for the prevention of Blindness(IAPB), had been launched in 1999 with the twin aims of eliminating avoidable blindness by the year 2020 and preventing the projected doubling of avoidable visual impairment between 1990 and 2020 . VISION 2020 advocates for increased awareness of the need for low vision services. Low vision services are aimed at people who have residual vision that can be used and enhanced by specific aids. A low vision resource centre is operating from Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, China, to distribute high quality, affordable low vision devices and equipment to all regions."

                "Many of the patients are old and frequently relatively immobile so that the retention of some ability to read is of vital importance. Low vision aids improve the reading capability and speed of reading. Visual aids for distance are less practical than those for near.\r\nAccurate refraction and appropriate illumination should be ensured for optimal retinal image.\r\nMagnification is the basis of most techniques used in low vision clinic. There are three methods of enlarging the retinal image :-\r\n\r\nBy bringing the object nearer to the eye.\r\nBy magnification of the retinal image.\r\nBy increasing the size of the object to be viewed.\r\n\r\nBringing the object nearer to the eye, leads to larger visual angle being subtended at the eye.\r\nMagnification, though increases the size of retinal image, leads to diminished visual field and reduced depth of focus. Due to this, lighting should be ample and directed on the fixation area. Therefore, lowest magnification compatible with useful vision should be employed .\r\nLow vision aids may be -\r\n\r\nOptical devices, such as magnifiers and telescopes.\r\nAdaptive non-optical devices, such as large-print reading material and talking watches.\r\nNon-magnifying visual aids.\r\nElectronic devices - computer software.\r\n\r\nOPTICAL DEVICES:-\r\nHand-held Magnifiers:- Hand \u2013 held magnifiers are the simplest type of magnifiers. The hand-held magnifier design involves a handle that is attached to a plus lens through which the user views an object. Since user must support the weight of magnifier, hand-held magnifiers are helpful for short term spotting task, like reading a prescription bottle or a price tag. There are illuminated or non-illuminated magnifiers with a variety of lens designs e.g. aspheric , aplanatic , biconvex , and diffractive lens.\r\nImage in Wikipedia(link is external).\r\nStand Magnifiers:- Stand Magnifier is a plus lens mounted on legs that fix the distance from the lens to object. Stand Magnifiers are good for extended, near tasks such as reading a book, newspaper or magazine and making small notes. There are illuminated or non-illuminated magnifiers. There are around-the- neck magnifiers , for jobs which require both hands to be free, like sewing and knitting.\r\nSome magnifiers may use variations like :\r\n\r\nCombination of lenses are also extensively used in magnifiers e.g. Hastings triplet magnifier.\r\nStepped lenses introduced by Fresnel can also be used as magnifiers. One type is essentially a plastic sheet with concentric ridges forming a series of prisms of increasing power from the axis to the periphery and has the great advantage of eliminating the thickness and marked aberration that would be unavoidable in a single large lens with a continuous surface.\r\n\r\nMagnifying Reading Glasses:- Magnifying reading glasses have plus lenses for short term use as a replacement, but cannot substitute the prescription glasses. These may be having constant power or are progressive to be used for varying reading distances . These may be of illuminated type, which can be used in the dark.\r\nSpectacle Magnifiers:- Spectacle magnifiers are ideal for extended near tasks like reading or working on hobbies because they allow users to have \u2018 hands free\u2019. These may be:\r\n\r\nClip\u2013 on system :- To be worn over the glasses.\r\nPrismatic eye wear :- Prisms are incorporated in spectacle to aid monocular or binocular vision. These may be bifocal, with normal reading power in upper part, and prismatic high power in the lower part for reading fine print.\r\nNoves spectacle magnifier :- It uses diffractive lenses which are much thinner than the lenses of similar power.\r\nSpectacle microscope magnifiers :- Have lenses of greater power than a traditional lens which forms a microscopic system when mounted on a spectacle lens. By holding the object closer, it allows an increase sized image with large field of view and clarity.\r\n\r\nTelescopes:- Telescopes as vision aids, are ideal for tasks at any distance ( near, intermediate or far ) and for any duration of time ( short term or long term ). Telescopes may be monocular or binocular, focusable or fixed-focus, hand-held or spectacle mounted.\r\nTechnical Magnifier:- Technical magnifiers are ideal for extended near tasks such as inspection, quality control or viewing objects. Technical magnifiers may be hand-held magnifiers or stand magnifiers.\r\nHigh power magnifiers are sometimes mounted in a cylindrical or conical holder with no handle. This is called a Loupe. These may be monocular loupe e.g. jewellers\u2019 and watchmakers\u2019 loupes or binocular.\r\n\r\nLoupe :Image in Wikipedia(link is external)\r\nBinocular dental loupes:Image in Wikipedia(link is external)\r\n\r\nAplanatic system of lenses such as exemplified in ophthalmic loupe, diminishes distortion of images.\r\nLamp Magnifiers:- Lamp magnifiers sit on or clamp on to a table or desk and have illumination. These are good for extended near to intermediate tasks that need both magnification and illumination in a hands-free design.\r\nNON- OPTICAL DEVICES:- Increasing the size of the object to be viewed helps in approach to low vision e.g. Large-size telephone bills or large-size print books. The benefits of optical devices, may be enhanced by non-optical means, such as improving light or reducing glare.\r\nFlexible-Arm Task Lamps:- Flexible-arm task lamps can be adjusted to a variety of tasks by providing proper light.\r\nFull Spectrum Light Bulbs:- Full spectrum light bulbs provide full range of colours found in sunlight, and hence more natural light. A sunscreen may be needed for longer duration of work, just as working out door in sunlight.\r\nAbsorptive Sun lenses/Sun glasses:- Absorptive sun lenses filter out ultraviolet and infrared light. These are helpful in bright light , reduce glare and increase contrast.\r\nColoured Acetate Sheetsz- Coloured acetate sheets, especially yellow or marigold, when placed on the page, can enhance contrast between the print and background, making words and letters appear darker and easier to read.\r\nNON- MAGNIFYING VISUAL AIDS:-\r\nStenopaeic Hole:- Stenopaeic hole is useful in any error of refraction or where the transparency of the ocular media is at fault. It is useful to a presbyope to read or write in an emergency.\r\nAs a stenopaeic slit, it may protect against ultraviolet radiation reflected from the snow.\r\nAs a reading slit cut in dark cardboard or plastic material, when placed immediately over print, may help patients with early lens opacities. In such cases, reflected light from the page is decreased and the contrast is thereby increased, allowing greater clarity in reading.\r\nELECTRONIC DEVICES:-\r\nVideo Magnifiers:- Video magnifiers use video cameras to project a magnified image onto a video monitor , a television (TV ) screen, or a computer monitor. Video magnifiers use stand-mounted or hand-held video cameras and are also called \u2018closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems\u2019. Apart from the undistorted magnification, CCTV offers two other advantages. The polarity may be reversed, allowing the print to be offered as white on black, the contrast is found helpful by some patients. It is possible to isolate one line of print, which may make it more intelligible.\r\n\r\nHand-held video magnifiers rest against the reading material and generally have a small integrated display. Some hand-held magnifiers can project magnified image on a television.\r\nStand-mounted like Desktop video magnifiers have a table surface on which the object is placed. Above the object, is a camera and monitor upon which the magnified image is projected.\r\n\r\nNewer Technologies:- Advances in consumer electronics is improving quality of life for people with low vision. Digital devices and apps offer options for portable, lower-cost low vision aids.\r\nE- readers- The iPad and other electronic- readers are portable, and allow the user to adjust the font size and contrast setting. They have text-to-speech functionality and can read aloud to the user. E-readers do not offer the same level of magnification as CCTVs.\r\nSmartphones and Tablets- Both Apple and Android based smartphones and tablets offer a range of apps and built-in functions to help people with low vision.\r\n\r\nMagnify, iRead and iLoupe use camera of device, and light source to magnify and illuminate text.\r\nSightBook app digitally communicate your vision changes to your ophthalmologist by measuring your visual function with a set of near vision tests.\r\nMapquest app provides voice-guided directions and tells the driver when to turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLimitations of Low Vision Services:-\r\n\r\n\r\nProvision of low vision services is generally not favoured by eye-care providers because of the low economic gain.\r\nThe need for low vision services is often not fully recognised, owing to inadequate data.\r\nThere is little evidence for the cost-effectiveness of low vision care interventions.\r\nPersons with low vision are often unaware that they can be helped.\r\nIn some, there may be lack of encouragement on the part of the tester; in others, there may be poor motivation on the part of the patient.\r\nSome patient may feel that forcing himself to see may accelerate a deterioration of his condition.\r\nCommunication and referral between eye-care, special education, rehabilitation and low vision services are often inadequate.\r\nPlanning for low vision services is inadequate."

                "Lid imbrication syndrome refers to abnormality of lid apposition in which upper eyelid overrides the lower eyelid. This causes lower eyelid lashes and keratinised epithelium to rub chronically against the upper eyelid marginal tarsal conjunctiva. This leads to keratinisation of the upper eyelid margin and metaplasia of the distal tarsal conjunctiva. The resulting abnormal distal superior palpebral surface, in turn, irritates the underlying corneal surface on blinking and prohibits normal replenishment of the tear film. There are symptoms of dryness due to poor tear film being produced by disruption in tear film mechanics. It may lead to persistent corneal epithelial defects.\r\nThis condition as a cause of chronic conjunctivitis was initially described by Karesh and others (1993). This disorder may have some overlap with floppy eyelid syndrome.\r\nBecause the upper eyelid overlies the lower eyelid, visualisation of eyelid apposition during closure of eyes may be difficult, and hence, this disorder may be missed. Many patients may be misdiagnosed as a case of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome)."

As a result, many patients tolerate lower eyelid retraction with minimal symptoms, if the upper lid function is normal.\r\nLid imbrication syndrome causes ocular surface problems through the mechanical rubbing of eyelashes against the conjunctival and corneal surfaces. It is not only the trauma of the eyelashes rubbing, but also the induced chronic low grade inflammation which contributes. It further exacerbates the disease process."

Distribution of the punctate epithelial keratopathy depends upon the position of cornea during sleep in patients with nocturnal lagophthalmos.\r\nExternal examination for complete eyelid closure should be done with patient gently closing the eyes.\r\nAcute seventh intracranial nerve dysfunction, due to Bell\u2019s palsy, trauma, or iatrogenic injury, may cause lagophthalmos. In cases with subtle orbicularis oculi muscle weakness, manual distraction of the eyelids during forced closure may expose weakness that may cause nocturnal lagophthalmos or incomplete blink.\r\nIt is important to check corneal sensation to rule out any component of fifth intracranial nerve dysfunction.\r\nThe vertical dimension of upper and lower eyelid skin must be evaluated in patients with suspected lagophthalmos. In the lower eyelids, vertical shortage will be apparent usually and will manifest as \u2018sclera show\u2019 and eyelid retraction. However, in upper eyelids the eyelid margin often rests at normal height, and only with downward distraction of the eyelid does the vertical skin shortness becomes apparent.\r\nFunction of levator palpebrae superioris muscle (during excursion of the eyelid from up to down), should be measured in all patients suspected of lagophthalmos. Patients with inadequate mobility of the upper eyelid retractors may have lagophthalmos despite a normal vertical amount of skin.\r\nSymblepharon between the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva in superior fornix may also limit downward excursion of the upper eyelid thereby causing lagophthalmos.\r\nGlobe protrusion increases the amount of eyelid excursion necessary to cover the cornea fully during closure of eyes. Lagophthalmos associated with proptosis may lead to exposure keratopathy.\r\nNocturnal lagophthalmos causes foreign body sensation and watering of eyes on awakening.\r\nComatose patients often show lagophthalmos due to inadequate tone of central seventh intracranial nerve."

                "Lead poisoning is one of the most common diseases of toxic environmental origin and accounts for about 0.6% of the global burden of disease. Lead is a naturally occurring heavy metal found in the earth\u2019s crust. It is soft, malleable, and melts at a relatively low temperature. It is easily moulded and can be combined with other metals to form alloys.\r\nIt is widely used in many products such as lead-acid batteries for motor vehicles, pigments, paints, solder, stained glass, lead crystal glassware, ammunition, ceramic glazes, jewellery, and toys and in some cosmetics and traditional medicines.\r\nMining, smelting, manufacturing and recycling activities, and the continued use of leaded paint, leaded gasoline, and leaded aviation fuel (in some countries) are important sources responsible for environmental contamination. Drinking water supplied through lead pipes or pipes joined with lead solder may contain lead. Widespread use of lead has resulted in to extensive environmental contamination and health problems in many parts of the world. Humans also suffer from lead intoxication through the food chain.\r\nLead is a cumulative toxicant (increasing in quantity in the body over many years) that affects multiple body systems (neurologic, hematologic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal systems).Young children are more susceptible to toxic effects of lead and can suffer with permanent adverse effects on their health. Adults exposed to lead are at increased risk of developing high blood pressure and kidney damage. Exposure of pregnant women to high levels of lead can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth and low birth weight and malformations.\r\nLead has no essential role in the human body. No safe level of lead exposure has so far been established. Even blood lead concentrations as low as 5 \u00b5g/dl may result in decreased intelligence in children, behavioural difficulties and learning problems; therefore prevention from exposure is important. The phasing-out of lead from petrol is a major international public health achievement but still global consumption of lead is increasing because of increasing demand for energy-efficient vehicles.\r\nLead paint can cause a long-lasting hazard to health in all age groups. Since leaded paint is a continuing source of exposure in many countries, World Health Organization (WHO), along with the United Nations Environment Programme has formed the \u201cGlobal Alliance to Eliminate Lead Paint\u201d. Its broad objective is to promote a phase-out of the manufacture and sale of paints containing lead and eventually to eliminate the risks involved with such paints.\r\nThe Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MOEFCC), Government of India has passed a notification in November 2016 as \u201cRegulation on Lead contents in Household and Decorative Paints Rules, 2016\" and has prohibited manufacture, trade, import as well as export of household and decorative paints containing lead or lead compounds in excess of 90 parts per million (ppm). Efforts should be made to create public awareness about precautionary measures to be taken to prevent lead poisoning."

                "Normally lactose (milk sugar) breaks down by lactase in the small intestine in to two simple sugars glucose and galactose, which are absorbed into the bloodstream through the intestinal lining. Lactase is an enzyme which helps in the process of digestion of lactose.\r\nWhen the small intestine has deficient or low levels of lactase enzymes, lactose is not properly digested and the undigested lactose passes into the colon (large intestine).Bacteria present in the colon break down the lactose and create fluid and gas. In some people, this extra fluid and gas causes symptoms of lactose intolerance.\r\nLactase deficiency may be of two types:\r\n(i)Primary lactase deficiency: In this type of lactase deficiency genes play an important role, such as:\r\n\r\nCongenital lactase deficiency: It is a rare condition, in this the small intestine makes little or no lactase since birth. This form oflactose intoleranceresults in severe diarrhea.\r\nLactase non-persistence:In this, the small intestine makes less lactase after infancy and it gets lower with age. Symptoms of lactose intolerance may not begin until later childhood, the teen years, or early adulthood.\r\n\r\n(ii)Secondary lactase deficiency: As not all cases of lactose intolerance are genetic, the following conditions can also lead to lactose intolerance:\r\n\r\nInjury to the small intestine due to infectious disease or other conditions may cause lactose intolerance such as Rotavirus and Giardia infections. Secondary lactase deficiency can also occur in celiac disease, Crohn\u2019s disease.\r\nPremature birth: In premature babies the small intestine may not make enough lactase for a short duration of time after birth but as baby gets older the small intestine usually makes more lactase.\r\n\r\n(iii)Acquired Lactase Deficiency:Many individuals acquire lactose intolerance as they get older. This condition is due to a normal decline in the amount of the enzyme lactase present in the small intestine as age increases."

If a mosquito bites a person infected with malaria, it can also become infected and spread the parasite on to others. During the bite of female mosquitoes, the half matured parasite transmits from the saliva of the mosquitoes into the small blood vessels (circulatory system) of the human through a special body part of the mosquitoes called as Proboscis. The parasite enters the bloodstream and travels to the liver. In the blood, the parasites travel to the liver cell and there they mature and reproduce. The infection develops in the liver before re-entering the bloodstream and invading the red blood cells. The parasites grow and multiply in the red blood cells. At regular intervals, the infected blood cells burst, releasing more parasites into the blood. Infected blood cells usually burst every 48 to 72 hours. Each time they burst, one will have a bout of fever, chills and sweating.\r\nMan develops disease after 10 to 14 days (incubation period) of being bitten by an infective mosquito.

There are five distinct stages of migraine, though not everyone goes through all the stages:\r\n\r\n'Prodromal' (pre-headache) stage: Some people experience changes in mood, energy levels, behaviour and appetite, and sometimes aches and pains several hours or days before an attack.\r\nAura: Some people experience a sensation, or aura, just before their migraine starts. Symptoms of aura include flashes of light or blind spots, difficulty focusing, and seeing things as if they are looking through a broken mirror. This stage normally lasts around 15 minutes to an hour.\r\nHeadache stage: This is usually a pulsating or throbbing pain on one side of the head. It is associated with nausea or vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to bright light and loud sounds, with a strong desire to lie down in a darkened room. This stage lasts for four to 72 hours.\r\nResolution stage: Most attacks gradually fade away. Some people find the headache stops suddenly after they have been sick. Sleep often relieves the symptoms.\r\n'Postdromal' or recovery phase: There may be a stage of exhaustion and weakness afterwards. Other symptoms can also occur during a migraine. These include:\r\n\r\nPoor concentration\r\nSweating\r\nFeeling very hot or very cold\r\nAbdominal pain\r\nA frequent need to urinate"

A cold and pale skin is common and points to vasoconstriction. Some patients have low-grade fever (38\u201339 \u00b0C). Blood pressure may be elevated or decreased, and the pulse can become irregular.\r\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)\r\n12-lead electrocardiogram showing ST-segment elevation in I and V1-V5 with reciprocal changes (blue) in the inferior leads, indicative of an anterior wall myocardial infarction. The 12 lead ECG is used to classify patients into one of three groups:\r\n\r\nThose with ST segment elevation or new bundle branch block\r\nThose with ST segment depression or T wave inversion (suspicious for ischemia), and\r\nThose with so-called non-diagnostic or normal ECG. A normal ECG does not rule out acute myocardial infarction.\r\n\r\nErrors in interpretation are relatively common, and the failure to identify high risk features has a negative effect on the quality of patient care.\r\nCardiac markers\r\nCardiac markers or cardiac enzymes are proteins that leak out of injured myocardial cells through their damaged cell membranes into the bloodstream. The markers most widely used in detection of MI are the enzyme creatine kinase and cardiac troponins T and I as they are more specific for myocardial injury. The cardiac troponins T and I which are released within 4\u20136 hours of an attack of MI and remain elevated for up to 2 weeks, have nearly complete tissue specificity and are now the preferred markers for assessing myocardial damage. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction requires two out of three components (history, ECG, and enzymes). When damage to the heart occurs, levels of cardiac markers rise over time.\r\nAngiography\r\nTo restore blood flow, coronary angiography can be performed. A catheter is inserted into an artery (usually the femoral artery) and pushed to the vessels supplying the heart. A radio-opaque dye is administered through the catheter and a sequence of x-rays (fluoroscopy) is performed. Obstructed or narrowed arteries can be identified, and angioplasty applied as a therapeutic measure. Angioplasty requires extensive skill, especially in emergency settings. It is performed by a physician trained in interventional cardiology.\r\nExercise stress test\r\nMeasures heart rate while patient walks on a treadmill. This helps to determine how well heart is working when it has to pump more blood.\r\nDoppler test\r\nA Doppler test uses reflected sound waves to see how blood flows through a blood vessel. It helps doctors evaluate blood flow through major arteries and veins, such as those of the arms, legs, and neck. It can show blocked or reduced blood flow through narrowing in the major arteries of the neck that may cause infarction.\r\nNHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health.

The catheter is passed through blood vessels and up to heart, over a fine guide wire, using X-rays to guide it, before being moved into the narrowed section of coronary artery. Once in position, the balloon is inflated inside the narrowed part of the artery to open it wide. A stent (flexible metal mesh) is usually inserted into the artery to help keep it open afterwards.\r\nThrombolysis:\r\nThrombolysis involves giving injections which contain thrombolytics. Thrombolytics target and destroy a substance called fibrin. Fibrin is a tough protein that makes up blood clots by acting like a sort of fibre mesh that hardens around the blood. Thrombolytic medications used in the treatment of heart attacks include reteplase, alteplase and streptokinase.\r\nNHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health.

Microcephaly can occur as an isolated condition, or it can occur in combination with other major birth defects.\r\nAccording to World Health Organization (WHO), microcephaly is a rare condition. One baby in several thousand is born with microcephaly.\r\nBrazil has reported an unusual, sudden increase in babies born with microcephaly since May 2015. Brazilian Live Birth Information System (SINASC) reported the prevalence of microcephaly in Brazilian newborns as 5.5 cases/100,000 live births and 5.7 cases /100,000 live births in 2000 and 2010 respectively. Over the last three months of 2015, it went up to 99.7 per 100.000 live birthsa.\r\nRecently a base line estimate of birth prevalence of microcephaly affected births (total number of babies including both live born and stillborn with microcephaly per 10 000 births) in India was determined after a systematic review and meta-analysis of several studies. The pooled birth prevalence of microcephaly was shown as 2.30 per 10 000 births among 97155 birthsb.\r\nBabies born with micocephaly often have smaller brains which have not developed properly. Other symptoms like convulsions, physical and learning disabilities start to appear as child grows older.\r\nThere are no specific tests to determine microcephaly during fetal life, but ultrasound scans in the third trimester of pregnancy can be used to identify the problem. The most reliable method to diagnose the microcephaly in new born is to measure head circumference 24 hours after birth, compare the value with WHO growth standards and continue to monitor the rate of head growth in early infancy."

                "Mooren\u2019s Ulcer is a painful, progressive, and chronic disease of the cornea, which often is bilateral and may cause severe vision loss or even loss of the eye. It is characterised by painful peripheral corneal ulceration of unknown aetiology. The disease generally begins with intense limbal inflammation and swelling in episclera and conjunctiva. Corneal changes begin 2- 3mm from the limbus as grey swelling that rapidly furrows. It affects superficial one- third of cornea and then it progresses circumferentially and centrally. There is usually infiltration and undermining of the leading edge of the circumferential peri-limbal ulceration. The bed of the furrow becomes vascularised with vessels advancing into the base of the undermined edges. The central edges of the ulcer can develop an overhanging edge extending from limbus into the ulcer bed, with or without opacification and neovascularisation. Neovascularisation may occur up to the advancing edge of the ulcer but not beyond it. Tissue destruction and ulceration of the cornea is initially confined to the periphery, but it may progress in some patients to involve the entire cornea. Destruction of the cornea generally affects stromal tissue only, leaving behind an intact epithelium and endothelium. The ulcers are crescent- shaped and may leave behind either an opaque oedematous cornea or is replaced with a thin fibro-vascular membrane. It does not affect underlying Descemet\u2019s membrane. There is no associated scleral inflammation. Intense pain is a hallmark of Mooren\u2019s ulcer, which is generally lacking in other peripheral ulcerative keratitis. The disease may be refractory to all forms of available therapy.\r\nBowman (1849) first described what we now call Mooren\u2019s ulcer of the cornea (also known as chronic serpiginous ulcer and ulcus rodens). Mooren\u2019s ulcer as a clinical entity was first described in detail by Mooren (1867).\r\nWood and Kaufman (1971) postulated that there are two distinct populations of patients with Mooren\u2019s ulcer. These two clinical types of primary Mooren\u2019s ulcer are:\r\n\r\nType I: The limited type is typically unilateral, not associated with significant pain, and occurs in older patients (fourth decade and older). It is more responsive to local medical and surgical therapy.\r\nType II: Relentless, progressive type is more resistant to systemic immune-suppression. It is painful, bilateral and causes relentless, progressive destruction of the cornea, usually in younger individuals (third decade), many of whom are of African descent. It may progress to corneal perforation.\r\n\r\nHowever, the categorisation described by Wood and Kaufman has been refuted by Lewallen S and Courtright P (1990)."

                "The cause of Mooren\u2019s ulcer is unknown, but evidence suggests an autoimmune basis. Supportive evidence includes:\r\n\r\nPresence of plasma cells and lymphocytes in the conjunctiva adjacent to the ulcer.\r\nSerum of patients shows circulating antibodies to conjunctival and corneal epithelium.\r\nElevation of serum levels of immunogobulin (Ig) like IgA, IgG and IgM and lymphocytes sensitised to saline- soluble corneal antigen.\r\nIncreased antibody levels to a cornea- specific stromal protein antigen.\r\nIncreased helper T cell to suppressor T cell ratio.\r\nFavourable response to immunosuppressive agents in some patients.\r\nPresence of Calgranulin C, a unique cornea associated protein that is present in the cornea and is the target of auto-antibodies from patients with Mooren\u2019s ulcer. This calcium- binding protein is identical to a neutrophil protein found on the surface of filarial nematodes. Recognition of this complex on a filarial nematode is suspected to lead to autoimmunity to the cornea in patients with persistent parasitic infection resulting in Mooren\u2019s ulcer.\r\n\r\nMooren\u2019s ulcer may represent a final common pathway to a variety of insults to the cornea in susceptible patients. Trauma or infection may alter normal corneal antigens, which may lead to an autoimmune response. The cornea is damaged further, liberating altered corneal antigens that aggravate and perpetuate the process until the corneal stroma is completely destroyed.\r\nCertain conditions may be associated with Mooren\u2019s ulcer:\r\n\r\nAlkali injuries.\r\nTrauma.\r\nHerpes simplex infection.\r\nHerpes zoster infection.\r\nParasitic infections.\r\nCataract surgery.\r\nCorneal surgery.\r\n\r\nIn the past, Mooren\u2019s ulcer has been related to:\r\n\r\nMalnutrition.\r\nMetabolic disorder.\r\nTrophic disturbances involving the trigeminal cranial nerve.\r\nDeficiency of vitamin B1.\r\n\r\nSome patients have been identified who have an underlying chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus infection.

                "By definition, primary Mooren\u2019s ulcer is not associated with any systemic abnormality, except for the occasional association with hepatitis C. It is not associated with scleritis, which distinguishes it from other more common types of peripheral ulcerative keratitis associated with collagen vascular disease. Patients having other systemic disease including leukaemia, pyoderma gangrenosum and syphilis may also develop peripheral ulcerative keratitis. This classic idiopathic variety may manifest as either type I or type II.\r\nA secondary Mooren\u2019s ulcer like peripheral ulcerative keratitis may occur following other types of corneal inflammation, including trauma, cataract surgery, herpes simplex, herpes zoster and chemical injury with alkalis. Although these are not diagnostic of true Mooren\u2019s ulcer, they do support the involvement of an altered auto-antigen pathogenic mechanism. This is often unilateral and behaves clinically like type I.\r\nA small group of patients with aggressive disease progression are seropositive for hepatitis C.\r\nDiagnosis of Mooren\u2019s ulcer depends upon medical history, clinical examination and laboratory investigations. Laboratory investigations are required to exclude other systemic diseases.\r\nClinical features:\r\nMooren\u2019s ulcer is characterised by a progressive, crescentic, peripheral corneal ulceration which is slightly towards the center from the corneoscleral limbus. It is associated with a characteristic undermined overhanging edge. It typically progresses with an anterior, stromal, yellow- white infiltrate at the advancing margin. An overlying epithelial defect then may develop. The ulcer progresses both circumferentially and centrally. Progressive stromal melting affects first the deeper and subsequently the anterior stroma. Following stromal melting, a re-epithelialised, conjunctivalised, scarred and thinned cornea remains. Patients with minimal stroma left may be predisposed to perforation either spontaneously or following minimal trauma.\r\nIn aggressive form of Mooren\u2019s ulcer, inflammation may affect the entire cornea and perilimbal tissue. The cornea may perforate. It may have associated cataract, secondary glaucoma and uveitis.\r\nChronic Mooren\u2019s ulcer ultimately results in central area of hazy stromal tissue with severe peripheral thinning. There is no scleral involvement, but associated conjunctival and episcleral inflammation may be present. There is no lucid interval (clear zone between ulcer and limbus). Scarring is common and it may be associated with irregular corneal astigmatism.\r\nCorneal topography: Corneal topography shows peripheral steepening and severe irregular corneal astigmatism.\r\n\r\nSrinivasan and colleagues (2007) described three patterns of corneal ulceration:\r\n\r\nPartial peripheral ulceration: Partial peripheral ulceration may be sub-divided into nasal, temporal, superior and inferior ulceration. Nasal and temporal involvement is more common.\r\nComplete peripheral ulceration: In complete peripheral ulceration, the disease encompasses the corneal periphery, leaving behind a central island of cornea that is often opacified.\r\nTotal corneal ulceration: In total corneal ulceration, the stroma is completely replaced with a fibro-vascular membrane.\r\n\r\nWatson and colleagues (1997) classified the disease into three types based on clinical features, anterior segment fluorescein angiographic findings, and treatment response:\r\n\r\nUnilateral Mooren\u2019s ulceration: Unilateral Mooren\u2019s ulceration is excessively painful and occurs in elderly. Affected eyes are red but inflammation does not extend beyond 3mm from the limbus. Ulceration extends around the globe and often leaves an opaque central cornea. The central corneal stroma is eventually removed. Anterior segment fluorescein angiography shows venular occlusion of local episcleral and conjunctival blood vessels along with disruption of the limbal arcade and vascular leakage from deep vessels at the limbus and base of the ulcer. In addition, vaso- obliteration of superficial vascular networks is characteristic of unilateral Mooren\u2019s ulcer.\r\nBilateral aggressive Mooren\u2019s ulcer: Bilateral aggressive Mooren\u2019s ulcer occurs in younger patients and the pain is less severe. Grey patches occur in corneal stroma about 2mm from the edge of the limbus. These grey patches then aggregate and lead to a typical Mooren\u2019s ulcer that progress first circumferentially and then centrally. Fluorescein angiography shows vascular leakage and new vessel formation that reaches the base of the ulcer. Angiography may also show changes in episcleral vessels and blockage in addition to break-up of the limbal arcade.\r\nBilateral indolent Mooren\u2019s ulcer: Bilateral indolent Mooren\u2019s ulcer occurs in middle aged patients who exhibit corneal guttering in both eyes with little inflammation. Both eyes tend to be involved at presentation, but the disease is often more severe in one eye. Most cases are gradually progressive but some heal spontaneously. Vascular architecture is normal with the exception that new vessels may extend into the base of the ulcer.\r\n\r\nSince Mooren\u2019s ulcer is a clinical diagnosis, it is not necessary to conduct all investigations, if Watson\u2019s criteria is met.\r\nWatson\u2019s criteria:\r\n\r\nCrescent shaped peripheral corneal ulcer.\r\nExtensive undermining of the central edge of the ulcer.\r\nCorneal infiltrations along the leading edge.\r\nAbsence of scleritis.\r\nAbsence of detectable systemic disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaboratory investigations include:\r\nBlood examination: It includes complete and differential blood cell count including platelet counts and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).\r\nSerology: It includes measurement of rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test.\r\nIn addition, certain tests like measurement of liver enzymes, blood urea nitrogen, serum protein electrophoresis and urinalysis may also be required.\r\n\r\nPathology:\r\nIn Mooren\u2019s ulcer, three zones of corneal involvement have been described.\r\n\r\nSuperficial stroma: Superficial stroma contains plasma cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, neovascular elements and disrupted collagen lamellae.\r\nMidstroma: Midstroma shows an increase in number of fibroblasts.\r\nDeep stroma: Deep stroma is infiltrated primarily by macrophages. The epithelial basement membrane is disrupted at the leading edge and the infiltrate contains primarily neutrophils.\r\n\r\nConjunctiva: Conjunctival resections show mononuclear infiltrate in the substantia propria, which contains plasma cells, histiocytes and eosinophils.\r\nThe presence of tissue- fixed auto-antibodies and complement also has been reported in the epithelial basement membrane of the cornea and conjunctiva.\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis:\r\nMooren\u2019s ulcer is a rare disease. The differential diagnosis includes other inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions causing peripheral thinning such as:\r\n\r\nTerrien\u2019s marginal degeneration: Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration is a non-inflammatory peripheral corneal thinning disorder that is usually bilateral, superior, and not associated with significant pain or inflammation unless there is an associated episcleritis or superficial scleritis. The corneal epithelium remains intact and the disease slowly progresses in circumferential manner without involving central cornea.\r\nPellucid marginal degeneration: Pellucid marginal degeneration causes inferior corneal thinning and irregular against-the-rule astigmatism but lacks the inflammation and pain seen in Mooren\u2019s ulcer.\r\nSenile furrow degeneration: Senile furrow degeneration causes thinning between the limbus and the arcus in elderly patients. However, no inflammation or vascularisation occurs.\r\nPeripheral marginal keratitis (catarrhal ulcer): Peripheral marginal keratitis (catarrhal ulcer), seen in association with staphylococcal blepharitis, may also show peripheral infiltrates. The infiltrate is usually unilateral and is separated from the limbus by a lucid interval (a clear zone). Associated pain is not severe. The disease has a benign course, and is self- limited.\r\nCollagen vascular diseases: Collagen vascular diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, polyarteritis nodosa, and Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis, may also be associated with peripheral corneal infiltrates and ulcers with features similar to Mooren\u2019s ulcer and an associated scleritis. The characteristic marginal furrows of rheumatoid arthritis are located about 1mm within the limbus and usually bilaterally in the inferior cornea. It may be superficial and nonprogressive, or it may progress to epithelial breakdown, marked stromal thinning with formation of descemetocele, and finally perforation. The marginal furrows may encircle the cornea. Occasionally, the entire superficial part of the remaining central corneal stroma may slough away."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nThe objective and goal of therapy of Mooren\u2019s ulcer is to stop the progression of the ulcerative process and promote re- epithelialisation of the ulcerated area. Symptoms of pain and photophobia and inflammatory signs of conjunctival hyperaemia and oedema generally disappear shortly after healing is complete.\r\nBrown and Mondino (1984) suggested a stepladder approach that includes topical corticosteroids, conjunctival resection, and systemic immunosuppressives.\r\nMedical therapy:\r\n\r\nTopical corticosteroids: To begin with, patients with Mooren\u2019s ulcer are treated with topical corticosteroids, as long as there is no sign or danger of imminent perforation. The frequency of topical steroids may be slowly tapered, if the ulcer heals completely. Aggressive therapy with topical corticosteroids may be effective in unilateral and bilateral non simultaneous cases, but not treated aggressively in bilateral simultaneous cases. Topical steroids must be used with extreme caution in patients having associated rheumatoid arthritis.\r\n\r\nPatients with Mooren\u2019s ulcer are prescribed antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection, and cycloplegics to control pain from spasm of the ciliary body.\r\n\r\nSystemic immunosuppressives: Systemic immunosuppressives may be employed in patients with bilateral and progressive disease, and also where conjunctival excision does not result in total healing of ulcer. If healing does not occur after one or two months, immunosuppressive therapy is slowly decreased and then discontinued. If some healing is observed, the medication is continued until complete healing. The dosage of the treatment is titrated to maintain haemoglobin and blood counts. Common immunosuppressive drugs used are cyclophosphamide, azathioprine with or without steroids, and methotrexate. Some treat Mooren\u2019s ulcer with systemic and topical cyclosporine A. The efficacy of topical cyclosporine is attributed to local depression of ocular immune-pathologic reaction.\r\n\r\nSystemic immunosuppressives may also be used for peripheral corneal ulcers associated with collagen vascular diseases. Systemic immunosuppressive agents, including corticosteroids, have been effective in the treatment of scleritis and ulcerative keratitis. Cytotoxic agents may improve long- term survival.\r\nSystemic immunosuppression would likely be contraindicated in a patient with chronic hepatitis C infection, so it is important to exclude it beforehand.\r\n\r\nInterferon- \u03b12b: Recently, an association has been reported between Mooren\u2019s ulcer and hepatitis C infection. Some cases of bilateral ulcer that did not respond to conventional therapy showed improvement with systemic interferon- \u03b12b for the chronic active hepatitis.\r\nRebetron: Rebetron is a newer treatment option. It combines interferon with the antiviral drug ribavirin.\r\nTopical lecithinated superoxide dismutase: A novel experimental therapy with topical lecithinated superoxide dismutase limited tissue destruction in patients who failed to topical corticosteroid therapy.\r\n\r\nIn addition, bandage contact lenses may reduce discomfort and promote epithelial healing. Subconjunctival heparin injections and topical collagenase inhibitors have also been used.\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\n\r\nConjunctival resection: Conjunctival resection may be performed adjacent to the ulcer in patients who show incomplete or no response to topical corticosteroids. About 3mm of conjunctiva is resected from the corneoscleral limbus and adjacent to the corneal ulcer. The epithelium in the bed of ulcer and less than 0.2mm of corneal epithelium central to the ulcer are removed by simple debridement.\r\nCryotherapy: Cryotherapy of the conjunctiva adjacent to the affected cornea. It gives similar results as are obtained with conjunctival excision.\r\nTissue adhesives (isobutyl- cyanoacrylate): Tissue adhesives (isobutyl- cyanoacrylate) may be applied if the corneal perforation is less than 1mm in size. There may be an arrest of ulceration if the application is done at an early stage before corneal perforation. The adhesive rapidly polymerises and becomes a solid adhesive on contact with water.\r\nKeratoplasty: Keratoplasty may be required when the corneal perforation is too large for tissue adhesive to seal and prevent the leak.\r\n\r\n- Patch graft: Patch graft may range from a tapered plug of corneal tissue to a peripheral penetrating keratoplasty. A small piece of corneal tissue is crafted into a tapering plug to fill the defect. The margins of the perforation site are cleaned of any necrotic material and epithelial tissue.\r\n-Partial penetrating keratoplasty: Partial penetrating keratoplasty may be performed in cases with larger peripheral perforations.\r\n-Penetrating keratoplasty: Penetrating keratoplasty shows poor results and has been described for patients with healed Mooren\u2019s ulcer. Penetrating keratoplasty may be complicated by the recurrence and extension of the disease process into the donor tissue with resultant necrosis and sloughing. Penetrating keratoplasty may restore some vision in a healed and quiet eye with an opaque or scarred cornea.\r\n-Crescentic annular lamellar graft: Crescentic annular lamellar graft is rarely used in cases of peripheral corneal thinning, when the cornea is not perforated.\r\n-Central lamellar keratectomy: Some advocate removal of the presumed antigenic corneal stroma by central lamellar keratectomy, in an attempt to mediate a more rapid resolution of the inflammation.\r\n\r\nAmniotic membrane transplantation: Amniotic membrane transplantation is an alternative treatment for reconstruction of ocular surface and corneal stroma damaged by an immunologic process. The exact mechanism of its function is not known but it has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory and anti- immunogenic qualities. A single layer amniotic membrane transplantation involves placing amniotic membrane stromal side down onto the ulcerated defect. Multilayer amniotic membrane may be placed into a stromal ulcer defect.\r\nKeratoepithelioplasty: Keratoepithelioplasty is a new surgical procedure for the treatment of persistent epithelial defect in patients without healthy donor tissue in their fellow eyes. After a total superficial keratectomy, donor corneal lenticules covered by epithelium are placed at the corneoscleral limbus. The epithelium spreads from the lenticules and covers the center of the cornea.\r\nConjunctival flap: Conjunctival flap may provide comfort, reduce ocular inflammation, and promote healing in cases where medical/ surgical therapy fails, and patient experiences pain from recurrent epithelial breakdown with stromal ulceration. It is especially useful for elderly debilitated patients for whom prolonged hospitalisation and medical therapy may not be warranted.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nMost patients with unilateral disease respond fairly well to topical corticosteroids and conjunctival resection.\r\nThe prognosis is poor for more severe bilateral cases, and the primary goal is to reduce the chances of perforation and preserve the structure of the eye."

It is believed that in past the virus may have originated in bats and then transmitted to camels.\r\nHowever, more information is needed to figure out the possible role that camels and other animals may play in transmission of MERS-CoV.\r\nTransmission of Infection:\r\nNon-human to human transmission: Strains of MERS-CoV identical to human strains have been isolated from dromedaries in several countries, including Egypt, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. But the route of transmission from animals to humans is not fully understood.\r\nHuman-to-human transmission: The virus passes from human to human with close contact such as providing unprotected care to an infected patient, among patients and family members.\r\nMERS-CoV, like other coronaviruses, is thought to spread from an infected person\u2019s respiratory secretions, such as through coughing."

                "Myopia or short-sightedness is that type of refractive error where parallel rays of light coming from infinity are focused in front of the light sensitive layer of retina with eyes in position of rest.\r\nThe term \u2018myopia\u2019 was introduced due to the habit of myopic people of half closing the eyelids while looking at distant objects, so that they may have the advantages of a stenopaeic slit (a black disc punctured with a fine slit or hole).\r\nRefractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye.\r\nEmmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina. The far point in emmetropia (point conjugate to retina in non- accommodating state) is optical infinity, which is 6 meters. Ametropia (refractive error) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.\r\nThe term ametropia (refractive error) describes any condition where light is poorly focused on light sensitive layer of eye, resulting in blurred vision. This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near- sightedness), hypermetropia (far- sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age- related diminution of vision). A person who is able to see without the aid of spectacles or contact lenses is emmetropic.\r\nPrevalence and distribution of ametropia vary greatly with age. Majority of children in early infancy are found to be somewhat hypermetropic. During the school years, children begin to become myopic in increasing numbers. Astigmatism change relatively little with age."

                "Diagnosis depends upon clinical features and retinoscopy.\r\nClinical types of myopia\r\nCongenital myopia: Congenital myopia is present since birth but is usually diagnosed by the age of about 2- 3 years. Mostly, it is unilateral and manifests as anisometropia. Rarely, it may be bilateral. It is usually produced due to increase in axial length of the eyeball. Refractive error is usually around 8- 10 D. It may be associated with\r\n\r\nPrematurity.\r\nMarfan\u2019s syndrome.\r\nHomocystinuria.\r\nCongenital convergent strabismus (squint).\r\nCongenital anomalies of eyes such as aniridia, cataract, microphthalmos (small eyeballs), megalocornea (large cornea), and congenital separation of retina.\r\n\r\nCongenital myopia may be associated with amblyopia and congenital convergent squint. In bilateral myopia, child show some noticeable difficulty in seeing distant objects and tend to hold things very close to the eyes.\r\n\r\nSimple or developmental myopia: This is the commonest type and is also known as physiological or school myopia. It is not associated with any other disease of the eye. This results from biological variation in the development of eye. It may be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive condition. Axial type may signify just a physiological variation in the length of the eyeball. Curvature type is considered to be due to underdevelopment of the eyeball.\r\nMost patients are born hypermetropic, but later become myopic with age. It usually begins around 7 to 10years of age and increases during the growing years. Besides visual symptoms, child may have signs such as\r\n\r\nLarge and prominent eyeballs.\r\nSlightly deeper anterior chamber.\r\nSlightly dilated pupils.\r\nFundus is usually normal. Rarely, there may be myopic crescent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPathological or degenerative myopia: Pathological or degenerative myopia is a rapidly progressive refractive error resulting in high myopia during early adult life. It is usually associated with degenerative changes in the eye. It results from rapid axial growth of the eyeball. It may be linked with heredity or general growth process.\r\nPathological myopia results from rapid axial growth of the eyeball which does not fall within normal biological variations of development. Beside symptoms, patient show signs such as\r\n\r\nProminent large eyes due to elongation of posterior pole of eye.\r\nLarger cornea.\r\nDeep anterior chamber.\r\nSlightly larger pupils with sluggish reaction to light.\r\nLarge and pale optic disc with temporal myopic crescent. It may be peri-papillary (around optic disc) in some cases.\r\nSuper-traction crescent (retina being pulled over the disc margin) may be present on nasal side of optic disc.\r\nDegeneration of choroid and retina.\r\nFoster-Fuch\u2019s spots, as dark red circular patch due to sub-retinal neovascularisation and choroidal haemorrhage, may be present.\r\nAssociated lattice degeneration and/or snail track lesion may be present in the periphery of retina.\r\nRetinal tear, haemorrhage or retinal detachment may occur.\r\nPosterior staphyloma due to scleral ectasia at the posterior pole.\r\nVitreous degeneration.\r\nPosterior vitreous detachment seen as Weiss\u2019 reflex.\r\nContraction of visual fields and ring scotoma may be present.\r\nElectroretinography may reveal sub-normal electroretinogram due to chorio-retinal atrophy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquired myopia: Acquired myopia may be produced due to\r\n\r\nIndex myopia: It may be produced due to change in refractive index e.g. nuclear sclerosis of the crystalline lens.\r\nCurvature myopia: Increase in curvature of cornea or lens produces curvature myopia.\r\nPositional myopia: It may be produced by anterior subluxation of the crystalline lens.\r\nConsecutive myopia: It may be produced due to surgical overcorrection of hypermetropia or in pseudophakia with overcorrecting intraocular lens implants.\r\nPseudo-myopia or artificial myopia: This may be produced due to excessive accommodation and spasm of accommodation. Full hypermetropic correction in children may also lead to this.\r\nDrug induced myopia: Certain drugs such as pilocarpine, steroids or sulphonamides may also produce myopia."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nMedical therapy\r\nVisual hygiene: This is important to avoid asthenopia. Proper posture and adequate illumination is required during close work.\r\nOptical therapy:\r\nAppropriate glasses/contact lenses may be used to provide clear retinal image.\r\nMinimum correcting power providing maximum vision is given.\r\nChildren: Myopia up to 6 D in children, especially younger than 8 years, should be fully corrected and are advised to wear glasses constantly. It helps in developing normal accommodation- convergence reflex. Myopia should never be over-corrected.\r\nAdults: Patients younger than 30 years, usually accept full correction. Patients over 30 years of age usually do not accept full correction, and are prescribed with glasses keeping power slightly under-corrected.\r\nHigh myopia: As little correction as compatible with good vision is prescribed. Under-correction also avoids minification of the image.\r\nOptical correction of eye includes\r\n\r\nSpectacle correction: Spectacle correction may be given, but it produces minification of object size and distortion of peripheral image in cases with high myopia.\r\nContact lenses: These are particularly useful in cases of high myopia. These avoid peripheral minification in size as well as peripheral distortion of image.\r\nLow vision and visual aids: Visual aids are indicated in patients with progressive myopia with retinal degenerative changes where useful vision may not be obtained with spectacles or contact lenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy includes:\r\n\r\nLaser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK): Keratomileusis refers to carving of cornea. Excimer laser ablation is applied directly to the corneal stroma after reflecting a lamellar or partial- thickness corneal flap. The flap is returned to its original position, once ablation is complete. Recovery of vision usually takes few days and some patients even take few weeks.\r\nWavefront- guided LASIK: Wave front- guided LASIK or custom LASIK is a new wave front technology to program ablation pattern more precisely than the conventional LASIK.\r\nIntraLASIK (IntraLase): IntraLASIK uses femtosecond laser, which is more accurate than a blade and provides a huge margin in terms of precision and safety. Femtosecond laser creates a corneal flap at a pre-programmed depth and position.\r\nEpiLASIK: EpiLASIK is designed to create a thin flap in the epithelium. It is an excellent alternative for patients with thin and steep or flat cornea. The layer is preserved and later replaced following reshaping of cornea using excimer laser.\r\nPhotorefractive keratectomy (PRK): PRK also uses excimer laser to reshape cornea, but this procedure does not require lamellar flap. The laser is applied directly to the anterior stromal surface after removal of surface epithelium. A soft contact lens is prescribed after laser treatment. The corneal epithelium typically heals in about 4 to 7 days. Improvement of vision may take few weeks to several months.\r\nLaser sub-epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK): It involves cleaving the epithelial sheet at the basement membrane with dilute alcohol, applying laser as in conventional PRK, and repositioning the epithelium afterward.\r\nRadial keratotomy (RK): In RK, spoke- like cuts radiating from central cornea at about 90% corneal depth were given to balloon the peripheral cornea. Although RK surgery was effective, the results were often unpredictable and led to overcorrection, with progressive hypermetropia. RK surgery was soon replaced by laser vision correction with the introduction of PRK.\r\nRefractive lens exchange (RLE): Refractive lens exchange (RLE) is a surgical procedure that may correct refractive error by removing and replacing the clear crystalline lens of the eye with intraocular lenses (IOLs). RLE is an option for high refractive errors, where laser vision correction is not an option.\r\nPhakic intraocular lens (phakic IOL) implant: Phakic intraocular lens (phakic IOL) may be implanted in front of and attached to the iris or is placed just behind the iris. Phakic IOL is an alternative to laser vision correction with keratorefractive surgery.\r\n\r\n\r\nContraindications to surgery:\r\n\r\nCorneal or anterior segment diseases such as keratitis, conjunctivitis or corneal ulcers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis\r\nThe prognosis is good in simple myopia. The refractive error usually stabilises by the age of 21 years.\r\nIn pathological myopia, visual prognosis is always guarded. There is possibility of progressive visual loss due to degeneration. The retina is stretched and thin, which may lead to retinal detachment."

It spreads by airborne droplets released when an infected person sneezes or coughs and by direct contact with an infected person. In temperate climates the disease incidence is peak in winter and spring while in hot climates the disease may occur at any time of year. Many countries experience epidemics at intervals of 2\u20135 years. Humans are the only known host for mumps virus. It primarily affects the salivary glands and it is sometimes called infectious parotitis.\r\nIn countries where large-scale immunization against mumps has been implemented, disease incidence has dropped dramatically. Before introduction of mumps vaccine, annual incidences were ranging from 100\u20131000 cases/100000 population.\r\nIn India outbreaks and sporadic cases are reported throughout the year and from all regions of the country. Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Government of India, has reported about 45 outbreaks of mumps from the different parts of the country in 2016. Passive reporting of mumps cases is also done by Indian academy of pediatrics (IAP) through its web based infectious disease surveillance system (IDSurv).\r\nMumps is a vaccine-preventable disease. 121 countries or 62% countries of the world have included mumps vaccine in their routine schedule in the form of MMR vaccine."

The term madarosis was originally coined to denote loss of eyelashes due to destruction of hair follicles. But now, this term encompasses loss of cilia either of eyelashes or eyebrows or both. Loss of eyelashes is also known as milphosis. Madarosis as a clinical sign has varied aetiology. This may be a manifestation of local or systemic diseases. Chronic blepharitis is one of the common causes of madarosis. It may be scarring or non-scarring type, depending upon the aetiology.\r\nThe word madarosis is of Greek origin, in which \u2018\u2019 madao\u2019\u2019 means to fall off.\r\nEyelashes protect the eyeball from small foreign bodies due to inherent reflex closure of the eyes. Eyebrows protect bony ridges above the eyes. Eyelashes and eyebrows have important cosmetic function as well."

It is one of the reasons for early discontinuation of breastfeeding, which provides optimal infant nutrition\r\nWhen mastitis occurs during lactation, it is called lactation or puerperal mastitis and in non-lactating women it is called periductal mastitis. Untreated infective mastitis can lead to breast abscess, which is localized collection of pus within the breast. Breast abscess is also common in the first six weeks\u2019 post-partum, but may occur later.\r\nThe risk of mastitis can be reduced by providing ongoing support to maintain frequent, complete emptying of the breast and proper breastfeeding technique during lactational phase by health care providers."

                "Milk stasis and infection are two important causes of mastitis. Milk stasis is usually the primary cause, which may or may not be accompanied by or progress to infection.\r\nMilk stasis occurs when baby is not sucking properly, and milk is collected within the breast tissue of lactating woman, that may lead to non-infectious inflammation (or non-infectious mastitis). As the stagnant milk provides a suitable environment for the bacteria to grow (without effective removal of milk) non-infectious mastitis may progress to infectious mastitis, and further to formation of an abscess.\r\nVarious reasons for milk stasis may be:\r\n\r\nPoor attachment of the infant at the breast;\r\nineffective suckling;\r\nrestriction of the frequency or duration of feeds;\r\na blocked milk duct;\r\nan overabundant milk supply;\r\nlactating for twins or higher multiples.\r\nCracked nipple: Fissured or painful nipples may lead to avoidance of feeding on the affected breast and thus predispose to milk stasis. The commonest cause of trauma is poor attachment at the breast. Bacteria from women\u2019s skin or baby's mouth can enter the milk ducts through a crack in the skin of nipple or through a milk duct opening.\r\nA short frenulum (tongue-tie) in the infant has been observed clinically to interfere with attachment at the breast, and may cause cracked nipple.\r\nUse of a pacifier or a bottle and teat may be associated with poor attachment at the breast, sore nipples, and reduction in breastfeeding frequency and duration. Pacifiers may thus interfere with milk removal and predispose to milk stasis.\r\nTight clothing, and prone sleeping position are other mechanical factors that have been observed in connection with mastitis.\r\nMastitis may occur in the breast opposite to the preferred side for lactation.\r\n\r\nThe commonest organisms found in mastitis and breast abscess are coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus but less commonly, Streptococcus or    Escherichia colimay be found."

On clinical examination of the breast he/she will focus on looking for signs of inflammation (erythema, localised tenderness, heat, engorgement and swelling) and nipple damage.\r\nBreast abscess is characterized by symptoms similar to mastitis, with the additional sign of a discrete tender lump, which may be tense or fluctuant. The mass may have overlying skin necrosis suggesting that the abscess is \u2018pointing\u2019 (abscess is sitting close to the surface of the skin).\r\nExamination of the infant and attachment to the breast: The infant should be examined for anatomical conditions such as cleft palate or tongue-tie which may interfere with attachment.\r\nInvestigation- Mastitis is a clinical diagnosis and investigations are not indicated in the initial assessment. If symptoms don\u2019t improve few days after proper management following investigations may be advised.\r\n\r\nUltrasound: Breast infection that does not improve with a course of appropriate antibiotics should be investigated with breast ultrasound.\r\nMammography: It is not a first line investigation in lactating women but is indicated if clinical, sonographic or biopsy features are suspicious for malignancy.\r\nBacteriological examination: Breastmilk for culture may be obtained by collecting a hand-expressed midstream clean-catch sample into a sterile container (i.e., a small quantity of the initially expressed milk is discarded to avoid contamination of the sample with skin flora, and subsequent milk is expressed into the sterile container, taking care not to touch the inside of the container). Cleansing the nipple prior to collection may further reduce skin contamination and minimize false-positive culture results."

                "Management of mastitis consist of effective milk removal and antibiotics if infection is suspected.\r\nSimple analgesics like oral paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which are safe in breast feeding can be used to relieve pain.\r\nSupport for continued breastfeeding: In addition to effective treatment and control of pain, a woman needs emotional support. Continued breastfeeding should be encouraged in the presence of mastitis and generally it does not pose a risk to the infant. She needs reassurance about the value of breastfeeding that it is safe to continue breastfeeding and milk from the affected breast will not harm her infant.\r\nHot and cold packs to breast: As milk stasis is often the initiating factor in mastitis, mother can apply heat (warm compresses or a warm shower)) to the breast prior to feedings.\r\nEffective milk removal: This is the most essential part of management of mastitis. Antibiotics and symptomatic treatment may make a woman feel better temporarily, but unless milk removal is improved, the condition may become worse or relapse despite the antibiotics.\r\nMother should be encouraged to breastfeed more frequently, as often and as long as the infant is willing, without restrictions starting on the affected breast. If necessary express breast-milk by hand or with a pump, until breastfeeding can be resumed.\r\nInfant should be well attached to the breast during breastfeeding and if there is any problem with attachment, mother should be helped by health care provider/ caregiver. If attachment is painful, a breast pump can be used to drain the breast until the pain decreases enough to allow the baby to feed from the breast.\r\nMassaging the breast during the feed with an edible oil or nontoxic lubricant on the fingers may also be helpful to facilitate milk removal. Massage, by the mother or a helper, should be directed from the blocked area moving toward the nipple.\r\nAntibiotic therapy: Health care provider may advise for antibiotic therapy in following situations:\r\n\r\ncell and bacterial colony counts and culture of breast milk are available and indicate infection,\r\nsymptoms are severe from the beginning, or\r\na nipple fissure is visible, or\r\nsymptoms do not improve after 12-24 hours of improved milk removal.\r\n\r\nThe chosen antibiotic must be given for an adequate length of time. (Tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol are not advised as they are unsafe for use in lactating women.)\r\nIdentification and drainage of breast abscess:\r\nIf an abscess has formed, it needs pus removal. This can be done by surgical incision and drainage under general anesthesia. Pus can also be removed by aspiration, guided by ultrasound, if available. This procedure is less painful and can be done under local anesthesia. Systemic treatment with appropriate antibiotics is also required along with aspiration of pus.\r\nMother should be encouraged for breastfeeding and should be reassured that milk is safe for her baby when she is taking appropriate antibiotic."

                "Breathing is a vital function of the human body, normally done through the nose. Abnormal, habitual breathing through the mouth instead of the nose is known as mouth breathing. It is a common clinical problem in children and is detrimental to their health.

Three tests that are commonly used in diagnosing narcolepsy are:\r\nThe polysomnogram:\r\nThe polysomnogram involves continuous recording of sleep brain waves and a number of nerve and muscle functions during nighttime sleep. When tested, people with narcolepsy fall asleep rapidly, enter REM sleep early, and may awaken often during the night. The polysomnogram also helps to detect other possible sleep disorders that could cause daytime sleepiness.\r\nMultiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT):\r\nFor the Multiple sleep latency test, a person is given a chance to sleep every 2 hours during normal waking time. The patient is usually subjected to an overnight sleep study.\r\nEpworth Sleepiness Scale:\r\nThe Epworth sleepiness scale is a brief questionnaire that is administered to determine the likelihood of the presence of a sleep disorder, including narcolepsy These tests are usually performed by a sleep specialist."

Fruit bats of the Pteropodidae Family, Pteropus genus are the natural host for the virus.\r\nNiV was first identified in Malaysia in 1998, during an outbreak of disease that occurred in a place called Kampung Sungai Nipah. Pigs were the intermediate hosts in this outbreak and most of the human cases resulted from exposure to ill pigs. After that in Singapore during March 1999 eleven abattoir workers developed NiV infection following close contact with imported pigs from Malaysia. \r\nOutbreak of Nipah virus infection was reported in Bangladesh in 2001. Since then, outbreaks of Nipah virus encephalitis have been reported almost every year in selected districts of Bangladesh. Consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated by flying bats was the primary source of human NiV infection in Bangladesh.\r\nIn India outbreaks of NiV infection were reported from Siliguri (January-February 2001) and Nadia (April-2007) districts in West Bengal. Seventy one cases with 50 deaths (70% of the cases) occurred in two outbreaks. Recently in May 2018 an outbreak of NiV infection is reported from Kerala. \r\nOutbreaks reported from South-East Asia have a seasonal pattern with occurrence during winter and spring (December-May). This pattern could be associated with several factors like the breeding season of the bats, increased shedding of virus by the bats and the date palm sap harvesting season. Nipah cases may occur in a cluster or as an outbreak.\r\nThere is strong evidence that loss of natural habitats of bats by human activity may attribute to emergence of bat-related viral infection communicable to humans and animals."

Complications may be mild such as hyperaemia with scant conjunctival discharge to permanent scarring leading to even blindness.\r\nNeonatal conjunctivitis may be septic or aseptic:\r\nSeptic neonatal conjunctivitis:\r\nViral and bacterial infections are the leading causes of septic neonatal conjunctivitis. Chlamydial conjunctivitis (caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serotypes D-K) is the most common infective cause of neonatal conjunctivitis. Infective agents causing neonatal conjunctivitis may be transmitted to infant during delivery through birth canal. Simple bacterial conjunctivitis may be caused by organisms like Staphylococcus aureus. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 may cause blepharoconjunctivitis and may involve cornea leading to keratitis.\r\nAseptic conjunctivitis:\r\nSilver nitrate solution (1 %) is used for prophylaxis (prevention) of infectious conjunctivitis (Cred\u00e9\u2019s method). Aseptic neonatal conjunctivitis is commonly caused by the use of silver nitrate solution resulting in chemical conjunctivitis. Less commonly, Neonatal conjunctivitis may also be caused by antibiotics as well, which are used for prevention of infection. Chemical conjunctivitis is less common owing to the use of antibiotic such as erythromycin eye ointment in place of silver nitrate solution for the prophylaxis of infective conjunctivitis.\r\nHealthcare providers and parents should wash hands frequently to prevent transmission of infection. Sexually transmitted infections such as Chlamydia, gonorrhoea and herpes simplex should be treated before the birth of infant through vaginal route.\r\nThe development of neonatal conjunctivitis in infant is influenced by the structure of conjunctival tissue. Inflammation may cause dilatation of blood vessels, discharge from eyes or chemosis (swelling) of conjunctiva. These changes tend to be more severe due to poor immunity, lack of immunoglobulin A (IgA), lack of tears at birth, decreased lysozyme activity and absence of lymphoid tissue in the conjunctiva."

Gonococcal conjunctivitis may lead to diffuse epithelial oedema, opacification and corneal ulceration (particularly in periphery), which may progress to corneal perforation or endophthalmitis (inflammation inside the eye).\r\nGonococcal conjunctivitis may be associated with systemic manifestations such as stomatitis, rhinitis, arthritis, anorectal infection, meningitis or septicaemia.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous non-chlamydial and non-gonococcal conjunctivitis:\r\nNon-chlamydial and non-gonococcal conjunctivitis may cause swollen lids, redness of eyes, chemosis with mucopurulent discharge, which are variable and often indistinguishable from other causes.\r\nPseudomonas conjunctivitis, though rare, can have devastating consequences, such as rapid progression to corneal ulceration and perforation. Untreated Pseudomonas keratitis (inflammation of cornea) may lead to endophthalmitis (infection inside eyeball) and may be life threatening.\r\n\r\nHerpes simplex conjunctivitis:\r\nHerpes simplex keratoconjunctivitis is characterised by unilateral or bilateral lid oedema, moderate conjunctival congestion, vesicles on periocular skin and non-purulent sero-sanguinous discharge. It may be associated with formation of conjunctival membrane.\r\nInvolvement of corneal epithelium shows typical signs of herpetic keratitis in the form of micro-dendrites or geographic ulcers.\r\nThere may be generalised serious systemic herpes simplex infection such as encephalitis (inflammation of brain) owing to poor immunological response in infants.\r\n\r\nLaboratory diagnosis: \r\nLaboratory tests for neonatal conjunctivitis includes following:\r\n- Conjunctival scraping for Gram stain or Giemsa stain.\r\n- Conjunctival scraping for polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR).\r\n- Culture on chocolate agar and/or Thayer-Martin medium.\r\n- Culture on blood agar.\r\n- Culture of corneal epithelial cells, if involved.\r\nLaboratory tests specific for suspected infectious aetiology include:\r\nChlamydial conjunctivitis:\r\n- Conjunctival scraping for Gram stain and Giemsa stain. Conjunctival scraping is taken and eye exudate is not enough to look for Chlamydial conjunctivitis (caused by Chlamydia trachomatis), since the causative agent is obligate intra-cellular parasite.\r\n- Conjunctival scraping for polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\r\nGonococcal conjunctivitis:\r\n- Culture on chocolate agar or Thayer-Martin medium for bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae.\r\n- Conjunctival scraping for polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\r\nMiscellaneous non-chlamydial and non-gonococcal bacterial conjunctivitis:\r\n- Culture on blood agar for the causative agent.\r\nHerpes simplex conjunctivitis:\r\n- Culture for Herpes simplex virus (HSV).\r\n- Direct fluorescent antibody test.\r\n- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\r\n\r\nRepeat cultures may be required if symptoms worsen or recur following treatment.\r\n\r\nTranscription-mediated amplification (TMA) test is a nucleic acid amplification test like PCR. TMA and PCR are more sensitive than culture in detecting chlamydial and gonorrhoeal organisms.\r\n\r\nCytological findings for various forms of neonatal conjunctivitis are:\r\n- Chemical conjunctivitis: Gram stain shows neutrophils with occasional lymphocytes.\r\n- Chlamydial conjunctivitis: \r\nGram stain: Gram stain shows neutrophils, lymphocytes and plasma cells.\r\nGiemsa stain: Giemsa stain shows basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions in epithelial cells.\r\n- Gonococcal conjunctivitis: Gram stain shows neutrophils and Gram-negative intracellular diplococci.\r\n- Miscellaneous non-chlamydial and non-gonococcal conjunctivitis: Gram stain shows neutrophils and infective bacteria.\r\n- Herpes simplex conjunctivitis: \r\nGram stain: Gram stain shows lymphocytes, plasma cells and multinucleate giant cells.\r\nPapanicolaou smear: Papanicolaou smear shows eosinophilic intra-nuclear inclusions in epithelial cells, but with low sensitivity.\r\nNeonatal conjunctivitis should be differentiated from:\r\n- Congenital obstruction of nasolacrimal duct.\r\n- Dacryocystitis.\r\n- Bacterial keratitis.\r\n- Fungal keratitis.\r\n- Preseptal cellulitis.\r\n- Orbital cellulitis.\r\n- Congenital glaucoma."

                "Neurotrophic keratopathy (NK), Neurotrophic keratitis or Trigeminal neuropathic keratopathy is a rare degenerative corneal disease. It is characterised by lack of or decreased corneal sensation, corneal epithelial breakdown and impaired healing, resulting into increased susceptibility of the corneal surface to injury and compromised healing. In severe cases this can lead to stromal melting, corneal ulceration and even perforation.\r\nMagendie (1824), first described this disease. Neurotrophic keratopathy was initially described as \u201cneuroparalytic keratitis\u201d and experimentally demonstrated by Magendie, who hypothesized the presence of trophic nerve fibers in the trigeminal nerve regulating tissue metabolism.\r\nA decrease or absence of corneal sensation is the hallmark of neurotrophic keratopathy (Groos Jr EB, 1997).\r\nCorneal sensitivity is controlled by trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve). Corneal nerves also provide trophic (nutritive) support and play a key role in maintaining anatomical integrity and function of the cornea, particularly of epithelium (M\u03cbller LJ et.al. 2003).\r\nThe cornea is supplied by the long ciliary nerve, derived via the nasociliary nerve from the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. Any localised ocular or systemic condition which affects the nerve function along this course of the nerve (from trigeminal nucleus to the corneal nerve endings) can create corneal anaesthesia, resulting into neurotrophic keratopathy.\r\nThe cornea is one of the most richly innervated parts of the body. Corneal innervation not only provides sensations but is important in the maintenance of structure and function of the cornea. Normal innervation helps to regulate epithelial integrity, proliferation and wound healing of cornea.\r\nThe management of neurotrophic keratopathy is one of the most difficult and challenging task. Aim of therapy in neurotrophic keratopathy is prevention of disease progression, preservation of globe integrity and promotion of ocular surface repair. Prompt and aggressive treatment is important to prevent serious complications like infection, corneal ulceration, and perforation."

                "The causes of neurotrophic keratopathy are all those conditions that decrease sensitivity of cornea. The most common are herpes infections of the cornea, surgery for trigeminal neuralgia, and surgery for acoustic neuroma.\r\nVarious causes and associations of corneal anaesthesia are:\r\nFifth cranial nerve palsy:\r\n\r\nIntracranial: Aneurysms, neoplasms, stroke.\r\nIatrogenic: Surgery for acoustic neuroma or trigeminal neuralgia.\r\nGenetic: Familial dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome), Goldenhar-Gorlin syndrome, M\u00f6bius syndrome, familial corneal hypoaesthesia, or congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis.\r\nFacial trauma.\r\n\r\nOcular:\r\n\r\nViral infections: Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster.\r\nToxicity: Chemical injury, toxic keratopathy due to drugs, chronic topical anaesthesia abuse.\r\nIatrogenic: Refractive laser surgery e.g. laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), trauma to ciliary nerves via laser or surgery, corneal incisions.\r\nContact lens wear.\r\nChronic ocular surface injury.\r\nOcular inflammation.\r\nDark colour of eyes.\r\nIncreasing age.\r\nAdie syndrome.\r\nThermal injury.\r\nOrbital neoplasia.\r\nCorneal dystrophies: Lattice, Granular.\r\n\r\nSystemic:\r\n\r\nDiabetes mellitus.\r\nVitamin A deficiency.\r\nLeprosy.\r\nMultiple sclerosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nPathogenesis:\r\nCorneal nerves are derived from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, and to a lesser degree from the maxillary nerve. The limbus and peripheral cornea also receive autonomic sympathetic innervations from the superior cervical ganglion. Disruption of sensory and sympathetic pathways is thought to lead to decreased cell division.\r\nNerves enter middle third of corneal stroma and run forward anteriorly in a radial fashion towards the center, where they lose their myelin sheath approximately 1mm from the corneal limbus. Stromal nerves form the sub-epithelial nerve plexus between Bowman\u2019s layer and the anterior stroma. They perforate Bowman\u2019s layer and form the sub-basal epithelial nerve plexus, providing innervations to the basal epithelial cell layer and terminate within the superficial epithelial layers. Thin branches of sub-epithelial plexus ascend and penetrate Bowman\u2019s layer, bending almost at a right angle to form the sub-basal nerve plexus at the basal epithelial cell layer.\r\nThe density of the sub-basal nerve plexus is reduced in NK and several predisposing disease states, including diabetes mellitus and viral keratitis. Reduced density of sub-basal nerves alters the concentration of several neuromediators and growth factors on the ocular surface. These neuromediators maintain a healthy ocular epithelial surface, in addition to altering rate of tear production. These include substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neuropeptide Y, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, gelatine, methionine-enkephalin and acetylcholamine. Tear gland also helps in maintaining a healthy ocular surface epithelium by providing growth factors and other nutrients.\r\nDeficiency in neuromediator reduces mitosis rates in epithelial cells, leading to epithelial thinning and surface breakdown. Limbal stem cells fail to replace central epithelium, resulting in a persistent epithelial defect. There is also a reduction in microvilli on the epithelial surface, causing poor adherence of tears to the cornea. Reduction of goblet cell density within conjunctival epithelium also alters tear composition.\r\nNerve growth factors (NGF) are mediators known to be essential for development and maintenance of both sympathetic and sensory nerves. NGF also produces acetylcholine and substance P. The cornea and conjunctiva have specific nerve fiber receptors that maintain normal corneal nerve density and help in preservation of the epithelium.\r\nNormally a bidirectional interaction occurs between epithelial cells and nerve endings. Reduced corneal sensations render the corneal surface vulnerable to occult injury and decreased reflex tearing. It also appears to decrease healing rates of epithelial injury resulting in non healing epithelial defects.\r\nConsequently, corneal sensory nerve damage impairs the neuromediator- epithelium interactions, which leads to impairment of epithelial maintenance and physiological renewal, and the development of recurrent or persistent epithelial defects."

                "Diagnosis of neurotrophic keratopathy is based on the clinical history, findings and evaluation of corneal sensitivity. Testing of corneal nerve sensitivity and imaging of corneal nerves aid in the management of NK patients who cannot have corneal transplantation.\r\nClinical history:\r\nClinical history should include causes that can cause local injury to corneal sensory nerves (chronic topical drug or anaesthetic abuse, previous ocular trauma or surgery, chemical injury or use of contact lenses), therapies that can cause impairment of trigeminal innervations (antihistamine, antipsychotic, and neuroleptic drugs), systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, and congenital diseases. Brain neoplasms and vascular accidents may damage the fifth cranial nerve or its nucleus.\r\nClinical presentation:\r\nImpairment of corneal sensation due to damage of trigeminal nerve leads to NK, which is characterised by ocular surface disorders such as:\r\n\r\nSuperficial punctate keratopathy.\r\nDryness of cornea.\r\nCloudy corneal epithelium.\r\nCorneal oedema.\r\nRecurrent and/or persistent epithelial defects of cornea.\r\nStromal melting.\r\nCorneal ulcers.\r\nCorneal perforation.\r\nDecreased blink rate.\r\nTear film instability with decreased tear film break up time (BUT).\r\n\r\nBased on the severity of corneal damage, Mackie (1995) classified neurotrophic keratopathy into three stages:\r\nStage 1: It is characterised by-\r\n\r\nSuperficial punctate keratopathy.\r\nRose bengal staining of the inferior conjunctiva.\r\nIncreased viscosity of tear mucous.\r\nDecrease in tear film break up time (BUT).\r\nEpithelial hyperplasia and irregularity.\r\nSuperficial neovascularisation of cornea.\r\nStromal scarring.\r\nScattered small facets of dry epithelium (Gaule spots).\r\nDellen (saucer-shaped thinning in peripheral cornea) formation.\r\n\r\nStage 2: It is characterised by-\r\n\r\nEpithelial defects, usually in the superior half of cornea with smooth and rolled edges.\r\nSurrounding rim of loose, poorly adherent opaque and oedematous epithelium around the epithelial defect.\r\nStromal oedema.\r\nDescemet membrane folds.\r\nInflammatory reaction in anterior chamber.\r\n\r\nStage 3: It is characterised by-\r\n\r\nCorneal ulcer.\r\nStromal melting.\r\nPerforation of cornea.\r\n\r\nClinical findings:\r\nCranial nerve examination:\r\nExamination of cranial nerves two to eight, including assessment of other divisions of the trigeminal (fifth cranial) nerve, may help in localising the site of underlying pathology causing corneal anaesthesia. Paresis of the third, fourth and sixth cranial nerves may indicate an aneurysm or cavernous sinus involvement that also affects the trigeminal nerve. Dysfunction of the seventh and eighth cranial nerve may indicate damage from acoustic neuroma or its surgical removal. Suspicion of cranial nerve diseases warrant blood tests for diabetes mellitus, hypervitaminosis A and imaging of brain and/ or orbit.\r\nOrbital and adnexal examination:\r\nOrbital and adnexal examination assesses the protection offered to the ocular surface by the eyelids.\r\n\r\nOver exposure of cornea: Over exposure of cornea may lead to dry ocular surface that may accelerate breakdown of the corneal epithelium.\r\nThyroid eye disease: Previous thyroid eye disease may produce lid retraction and proptosis.\r\nBlepharitis: Blepharitis may cause inflammation of ocular surface.\r\nTrigeminal nerve: Previous surgery or trauma to trigeminal nerve.\r\nSeventh cranial nerve palsy: Seventh cranial nerve palsy may produce lagophthalmos and corneal exposure.\r\nBlink rate: Blink rate reduction may result in failure to distribute tears evenly over the ocular surface. This may lead to secondary dryness and exposure of cornea.\r\n\r\nTear film evaluation:\r\nTear film may be quantitatively and qualitatively affected by the reduction of corneal sensitivity.\r\n\r\nSchirmer\u2019s test: Schirmer\u2019s test evaluates tear production.\r\nTear film break up time (BUT): Tear film break up time (BUT) evaluates tear film stability.\r\n\r\nOcular examination:\r\n\r\nConjunctiva: Conjunctiva may show Bitot spots, which are associated with hypovitaminosis A.\r\nAnterior chamber: Anterior chamber activity may lead to corneal anaesthesia due to uveitis associated with chronic inflammatory disease.\r\nDilated ocular fundus examination: Dilated ocular fundus examination may reveal diabetic retinopathy, optic nerve pallor or oedema due to raised intracranial pressure produced by an intracranial tumour.\r\nCornea: Corneal examination under slit lamp (biomicroscopy) should be conducted for assessment. Vital stains such as fluorescein sodium, rose bengal or lissamine green may be used to visualise ocular surface. Corneal examination may reveal-\r\n\r\n- Stromal scars from previous keratitis resulting in ocular anaesthesia.\r\n- Evidence of previous LASIK.\r\n- Corneal epithelial defects.\r\n- Any asymptomatic corneal dystrophy.\r\n- Secondary bacterial infection.\r\nCorneal sensitivity evaluation:\r\nCorneal sensitivity evaluation is vital test to confirm the diagnosis of NK. Assessment of corneal sensitivity may be useful to assess the severity of corneal nerve impairment. A difference in corneal sensitivity in different quadrants of the cornea may indicate a local cause for anaesthesia, such as viral keratitis. It can be measured:\r\nQualitatively: By touching the central and peripheral part of cornea with a wisp of sterile cotton swab.\r\nQuantitatively: By a corneal aesthesiometer.\r\n\r\nCochet- Bonnet aesthesiometer: Cochet- Bonnet aesthesiometer quantifies corneal sensitivity by the length of a nylon filament required to initiate a blink reflex or a patient response.\r\nNon-contact aesthesiometer: New non-contact aesthesiometer allow the evaluation of chemical, mechanical and thermal sensitivity of the ocular surface. Belmonte non-contact aesthesiometer stimulates central cornea with a series of pulses of warmed air at multiple pressures. The lowest airflow that is able to elicit a response is identified as the mechanical threshold. The chemical detection threshold is assessed by stimulating the central cornea with a mixture of air and various concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) with the flow restricted to below mechanical detection threshold. Thermal sensitivity threshold is assessed by changes in temperature of airflow.\r\n\r\nIn vivo corneal confocal microscopy (IVCM):\r\nIn vivo corneal confocal microscopy is a rapid and non-invasive imaging method, which provides understanding of corneal nerve morphology in health and in ocular and systemic diseases.\r\nICVM studies showed a significant decrease in number of sub-basal nerve fibers, and their density significantly correlates with reduced corneal sensation.\r\nHistological findings:\r\nHistological findings in neurotrophic keratopathy may show:\r\n\r\nDecrease in epithelial thickness with loss of surface desquamating layer.\r\nReduction of surface cell microvilli.\r\nIntracellular swelling of remaining surface epithelial cells.\r\nAreas of abnormal basal lamina.\r\nDecreased density of conjunctival goblet cells.\r\nIncreased length of surface microvilli.\r\n\r\nImpression cytology:\r\nImpression cytology may be necessary to rule out limbal deficiency of stem cells. Corneal epithelium is positive for cytokeratin 3 and negative for cytokeratin 19, while conjunctival epithelium is negative for cytokeratin 3 and positive for cytokeratin 19. If impression cytology from limbal area shows significant cytokeratin 19 (indicate conjunctival epithelium) and little cytokeratin 3 (indicate corneal epithelium), then the impression cytology would indicate limbal stem cell deficiency.\r\nNeurotrophic keratopathy should be differentiated from other ocular conditions with similar manifestations, such as:\r\nNeurotrophic keratopathy may have a similar clinical appearance to other ocular surface disorders at each clinical stage. History is often helpful in diagnosis towards NK and the presence of an anaesthetic cornea on clinical assessment is a critical sign.\r\nStage 1 NK: Features such as superficial punctate keratopathy and tear film abnormalities may be observed in diseases like:\r\n\r\nDry eye disease.\r\nExposure keratopathy.\r\nTopical drug toxicity.\r\nContact lens related disorders.\r\nMild chemical injury.\r\nBlepharitis.\r\nCorneal limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD).\r\n\r\nClinical history, clinical features and laboratory tests help in identifying the correct diagnosis, since all of these conditions may be associated with impairment of corneal sensation.\r\nLater stages of NK: Presence of corneal ulcers warrants exclusion of other causes, including immune and infectious, which are always present with ocular inflammation and stromal infiltration. Aetiologies to be excluded are:\r\n\r\nInfective corneal ulcer: A microbiological examination is performed to exclude viral, bacterial, or fungal infection.\r\nInflammatory corneal ulcer: Immune analysis for the presence of systemic autoimmune disease may be considered for an inflammatory ulcer.\r\nToxic-related corneal ulcer: History of topical therapy is necessary for a toxic-related corneal ulcer. Any local treatment should be discontinued to exclude drugs as the cause of toxic-related corneal ulcer.\r\nTraumatic epithelial defect: A history of trauma, even a mild injury, would be suggestive of a traumatic epithelial defect.\r\nRecurrent corneal erosion: Patients with recurrent corneal erosion may also give history of trauma."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nNeurotrophic keratopathy is one of the most difficult and challenging ocular diseases that lacks specific treatment, since no medication can improve corneal sensitivity.\r\nTill date, the treatment of NK is still conservative and any surgical procedure aimed at restoring corneal transparency should be discouraged because of the high risk of developing corneal epithelial defect, melting, ulcers, and perforation after surgery.\r\nThe primary aim of treatment is to protect the corneal surface and to promote epithelial re-growth. Treatment must begin early to prevent the progression of corneal damage and promote epithelial healing. Specific measures taken are based on the clinical stage of the disease at the time of presentation and severity of anaesthesia.\r\nStage 1 disease: Therapy in stage 1 disease aim at improving epithelial quality and transparency to avoid epithelial breakdown. A review of concurrent topical and systemic medications should be undertaken to minimise the use of therapies that might predispose to NK. Ideally, stage 1 disease requires discontinuation of all topical preparations. Other ocular surface associated diseases such as dry eye disease, exposure keratopathy and limbal stem cell deficiency disease, may require specific treatment.\r\nMedical therapy:\r\n\r\nTopical artificial tears: To protect corneal epithelium and to minimise ocular surface irritation from long-term use, preservative-free topical preparations are considered for lubrication. Other topical preparations, if used for pre-existing ocular co-morbidity, may also be obtained preservative-free.\r\nEyelid hygiene: Eyelid hygiene and treatment of blepharitis improves meibomian gland function and reduces the risk of secondary infection.\r\nOral doxycycline: Oral doxycycline may be used to treat blepharitis and reduce tear concentrations of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs have been implicated as a contributing factor of the surface epithelium failing to heal in recurrent corneal erosion syndrome.\r\nBandage contact lens: Bandage contact lens was previously used as a temporary measure to protect the corneal surface. Bandage contact lens may introduce infection and be a risk factor for secondary infective keratitis.\r\nPunctal plugs: Punctal plugs may be considered to block punctum, in order to increase tears on the ocular surface.\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\n\r\nSurgical correction: Any exposure of the corneal surface, secondary to either an eyelid defect or lid malposition, should be corrected by surgical means.\r\nLimbal stem cell transplantation: Limbal stem cell transplantation may be considered in patients of NK with associated co-morbid condition of LSCD to improve the prognosis.\r\n\r\nStage 2 disease: Epithelial defects should be treated to prevent the development of corneal ulcers, promote healing, and prevent the recurrence of corneal breakdown. All topical treatment for other ocular conditions should be discontinued, as there is significant risk of stromal lysis and perforation of ocular globe. While the mainstay of topical therapy is lubrication, there are several adjunctive topical therapies available to promote both corneal epithelial and nerve re-growth. Use of adjunctive therapy may be performed in combination with punctal plugging or a bandage contact lens.\r\nMedical therapy:\r\n\r\nTopical artificial tears: Like stage 1 disease, preservative-free topical artificial tears may be used to improve corneal surface.\r\nTopical collagenase inhibitors: Topical collagenase inhibitors (e.g. N-acetylcysteine) may be considered to prevent stromal lysis and globe perforation.\r\nTopical autologous serum eye drops: Treatment with topical autologous serum eye drops has been shown to promote epithelial regeneration and increase nerve density in the sub-basal plexus.\r\nUmbilical cord serum eye drops: Umbilical cord serum eye drops have also been shown to promote healing like topical autologous serum eye drops in a similar manner. Both preparations have been found to have significantly higher concentrations of neuromediators that play a role in corneal epithelial healing than human tears.\r\nNeuromediator preparations: Neuromediators and growth factors may represent a future therapeutic approach for the treatment and prevention of neurotrophic keratopathy. Preparations of individual neuromediators such as substance P in combination with insulin-like growth factor-1, epidermal growth factors, fibronectin and nerve growth factors, have been tried as a treatment of NK.\r\nInjection of botulinum toxin A: Injection of botulinum toxin A into the levator muscle induces temporary ptosis, and may be considered as an alternative to lateral tarsorrhaphy.\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\n\r\nLateral tarsorrhaphy: A lateral tarsorrhaphy may be performed to reduce the palpebral aperture, and thus the corneal exposure.\r\nPalpebral spring: Palpebral spring may be used for the eyelid levator to reduce the palpebral aperture thereby preventing corneal exposure.\r\nAmniotic membrane transplantation: Multilayered amniotic membrane transplantation may be utilised, more so in the management of refractory neurotrophic corneal ulcers. It is effective in promoting corneal epithelial healing and in reducing ocular surface vascularisation and inflammation.\r\nCorneal neurotisation: In cases of unilateral NK, surgical replacement by corneal neurotisation of the dysfunctional nerve has been described. Branches of the contra-lateral supra-orbital and supratrochlear nerves may be attached at the limbus of the anaesthetic cornea.\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociated ocular surface conditions also require treatment. Intensive preservative-free antimicrobial therapy is used for secondary bacterial keratitis. Topical corticosteroids reduce inflammation, but it requires close observation, as there is significant risk of precipitating stromal lysis and ocular globe perforation.\r\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are contraindicated due to their potential of causing corneal melting as a side effect from their anaesthetic properties.\r\nStage 3 disease: In stage 3 disease, the cornea is at significant risk of perforation. This requires immediate intervention to stop stromal lysis and prevent the perforation. In such cases, preservation of the globe integrity rather than preservation of vision takes precedence. Like stage 1 and stage 2, avoid toxic effects of topical preparations and only preservative-free topical artificial tears and prophylactic topical antibiotics may be used.\r\nMedical therapy:\r\n\r\nTopical artificial tears: Like stage 1 and stage 2 diseases, preservative-free topical artificial tears may be used to improve corneal surface.\r\nTopical collagenase inhibitors: In cases of corneal melting, topical collagenase inhibitors, such as N-acetylcysteine or medroxyprogesterone may be used.\r\nCorneal cyanoacrylate glue: Corneal cyanoacrylate glue application followed by insertion of a bandage contact lens may be used in the presence of small corneal perforations.\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\n\r\nConjunctival flap: Conjunctival flap may restore ocular surface integrity and provide metabolic and mechanical support for corneal healing. This is effective for the treatment of chronic corneal ulceration with or without corneal perforation.\r\nAmniotic membrane transplantation: In addition to other measures, multilayered amniotic membrane transplantation may be done to protect corneal surface.\r\nLateral Tarsorrhaphy: Lateral tarsorrhaphy is also effective in promoting corneal healing, but it provides a poor cosmetic outcome and visual function is sacrificed.\r\nLamellar and penetrating keratoplasty: Both lamellar and penetrating keratoplasty may be used for larger corneal perforations. As cases of NK are characterised by altered innervations and there is invariably limbal neovascularisation, perfoming keratoplasty is associated with a high failure rate and recurrence of an epithelial defect.\r\nBoston keratoprosthesis (Kpro): Boston keratoprosthesis (Kpro) may be an alternative to keratoplasty in the treatment of an anaesthetic cornea, but the risk of device extrusion from keratolysis and inflammation must be considered prior to Kpro surgery.\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nIt is important to stress to the patient to have frequent eye examination, since the disease often lacks signs and symptoms, and protection with preservative-free artificial tears to prevent epithelial breakdown is necessary.\r\nPrognosis of neurotrophic keratopathy depends upon:\r\n\r\nSpecific cause behind impairment of corneal sensitivity.\r\nThe duration of the condition.\r\nDegree of corneal anaesthesia or hypoesthesia.\r\nAssociation with other ocular surface disorders such as dry eye disease, exposure keratopathy and limbal stem cell deficiency.\r\n\r\nPrognosis of congenital NK is usually poor since no effective medical therapy is available. Most of the patients are likely to end up developing alterations in ocular surface or disease complications.\r\nUsually more severe the corneal sensory impairment, higher is the rapidity of disease progression towards stromal lysis/ melting, perforation and loss of sight due to anatomical loss of the eye or permanent loss of corneal transparency.\r\nPresence of associated ocular surface disease may affect the prognosis.\r\nEven in patients that do not have complete corneal anaesthesia or associated disease, sometimes even with timely appropriate therapy, neurotrophic keratopathy may may still progress to stage 3 (e.g. corneal ulcer). Neurotrophic corneal ulcer requires prompt treatment to stop stromal lysis and corneal perforation. Corneal ulcer may develop permanent diminution of vision from ensuing corneal scarring and astigmatism, even if there is no perforation."

Around half of all pregnant women experience vomiting, andmore than80% of womenexperience nausea in thefirst12 weeks. It is often called morning sickness as the symptoms are usually worse in the morning but can occur at any time of the day, and sometimes continue throughout the day.\r\nNausea and vomiting typically commence around weeks 8 or 9 of pregnancy and subside after 12\u201314 weeks. However, in 10% of pregnancies symptoms may continue beyond 20 weeks and even until birth.\r\nNausea and vomiting of pregnancy is not usually causing any adverse effects to developing fetus but can impair the daily routine/ activities of a pregnant woman.\r\nAdequate oral hydration and avoidance of dietary triggers are often sufficient to control the symptoms, but a proportion of women with severe and protracted nausea and vomiting need medical treatment.\r\nHyperemesis gravidarum: In about .3 to 3 % of pregnant women, severe form of nausea and vomiting can result in to hyperemesis gravidarum (HG). It can lead to dehydration, weight loss and electrolyte imbalance and often requires hospitalization. HG is associated with a higher incidence of low birth babies (LBW), small-for gestational age (SGA) and premature babies."

They feel alienated and the symptoms consume a lot of their time resulting in severe emotional, social, financial and other difficulties.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms must be consistent and continuing, consuming more than one hour a day and should not be secondary to any underlying medical disorder or the effect of a drug or substance of abuse, for a definitive diagnosis of OCD to be made.\r\n\r\nBody Dysmorphic Disorder: The person suffering from body dysmorphic disorder harbors the idea of a perceived or imagined defect in body shape or shape or any specific part and indulges in repetitive behaviors or mental acts in response to preoccupations with perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance. For e.g. a person believing that his/her nose is deviated to one side although no such defect is visible to others.\r\n\r\nHoarding disorder: The person suffering hoarding disorder finds it extremely difficult to part with possessions regardless of their value or utility resulting in emotional, physical social, financial, or even legal problems for the person himself and the family members. It is different from usual hobby some people have to collect certain items, in this disorder, they accumulate a large number of things filling up and cluttering active living areas of the home or workplace to the extent that the place cannot be used for the purpose it was meant for.\r\n\r\nTrichotillomania or Hair pulling disorder: A person having hair pulling disorder gets the urge to pull one\u2019s hair and experiences a lot of anxiety if he tries to resist it and a decrease in anxiety when he/she pulls the hair leading to gradual development of a visible loss of hair from the head. Sometimes the person additionally eats up the hair after pulling it. They are often brought to medical attention because of either unexplained loss of hair or stomach pain.\r\n\r\nExcoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder: This disorder is characterized by constant and recurrent picking at your skin resulting in skin lesions. The person fails to control the urge despite trying many times to reduce or stop it. This often results in medical complications like infections, scarring and physical disfigurement."

                "Obsessive compulsive and related disorders are treatable and majority of patients lead a quality life with proper and regular treatment.\r\nThe management of OCD and related disorders vary as per the specific disorder a person is suffering from, its severity, and patient profile e.g. (age/sex/body weight/social support/psychological mindedness/past history/family history/other physical or mental health disorders patient is suffering from). The outcome of treatment is best when medicines are used along with behavior therapy.\r\nIn general the therapeutic management comprises of a combination of\r\n1.Medications: These include various anti anxiety and antidepressant drugs.\r\nSSRIs (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) e.g. Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine, Sertraline, Paroxetine etc.\r\n\r\nThese are currently considered the drug of choice for moderate to severe OCD and related disorders.\r\nThe dosage used are often higher than what works for Depression or anxiety in general.\r\nThey modulate the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain and show their efficacy in 2-3 weeks.\r\nThey should only be taken under specialist guidance and any unwanted side effect or worsening of symptoms should be reported immediately.\r\nIn general SSRIs are relatively safer drugs as compared to the older antidepressants and the usual side effects are mild and usually self limiting e.g. headache, nausea, heart burn, nervousness etc, but you should immediately talk to your doctor if any unwanted side effect/change is noticed in body or mind.\r\nPatient should never start or stop the medicines on their own as it may lead to worsening of the problem, discontinuation syndrome or even a paradoxical increase in anxiety or suicidal tendency.\r\nDepending on the disease severity the medicine may have to be taken for longer periods.\r\nSSRIs and other antidepressants and anti anxiety medicines are not habit forming drugs.\r\n\r\nSerotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIS). Desvenlafaxine, Venlafaxine, Duloxetin are also antidepressants may be useful in some OCD related disorders as add on therapy.\r\nTCAs (Tricyclic antidepressants) e.g. especially Clomipramine\r\nThis is an older antidepressant and once was used to be considered as the drug of choice for OCD and they act on other neurotransmitters as well apart from serotonin. Currently not used as first line drugs but still is quite useful in some patients or sometimes as a second drug at lower dosage to augment the treatment.\r\nBenzodiazepines(BZDs)\r\nClonazepam, Lorazepam, Etizolam, Diazepam, Oxazepam, Chordiazepoxide.\r\n\r\nBZDs are also used to treat OCD and related disorders in the acute and short term. They are often prescribed along with SSRIs to provide short term relief from anxiety till the time SSRIs take their effect.\r\nThey are habit forming drugs and have abuse potential so they should be used in the short term under specialist supervision only.\r\n\r\nSerotonin dopamine agonists SDAs: e.g. Risperidone is useful in some patients as an add on therapy to augment the treatment or in patients who do not have insight into their OCD and related disorder or have co-morbid psychotic symptoms.\r\nElectro-convulsive therapy ECT: at times can be helpful in patients not responding to medications.\r\nRepetitive Trans Cranial Magnetic Stimulation rTMS: initial research seems promising in improving symptoms in some patients, more research is needed.\r\nPsychosurgery: Sometimes in extremely treatment unresponsive cases cingulotomy and capsulotomy is helpful, surgery may not cure the condition but it may help it become treatment responsive.\r\nDeep brain stimulation is another technique under research for treatment of OCD.\r\nOthers like Buspirone, Bupropion Hydrochloride, Mirtazapine, Valproate, Carbamazepine and Lithium are used as add on medicines in some patients.\r\nNote: The mediations should be taken under specialist guidance and any unwanted side effect or worsening of symptoms should be reported immediately.\r\n2.Psychotherapies\r\nA.Cognitive behavioural therapy: This form of psychotherapy is very effective in the treatment of OCD &amp; related disorders and it involves the therapist using various techniques to help the patient understand and manage the factors that contribute to their disorder. Cognitive errors are corrected and behavioural techniques are used to reduce or stop undesired behaviour and relaxation techniques like deep breathing are used to control the bodily manifestations of anxiety.\r\nB.Supportive psychotherapy: In this psychotherapeutic approach a variety of psychotherapeutic techniques are used to foster a healthy mental state in the patient through a supportive therapeutic relationship with the patient.\r\nC.Family therapy: Family psychotherapy can help family members better understand their loved one's OCD and learn new ways of communication and interaction that do not reinforce the OCD and related disorder and associated dysfunctional behaviours and this in turn ensures treatment compliance and improves the outcome.\r\nD.Group therapy: In this the psychotherapy is done with a group of unrelated individuals all having OCD and related disorder and it\u2019s a very useful way of providing effective treatment and generating support.\r\nOthers adjunctive therapies like Music therapy, art therapy and various meditation styles and breathing relaxation techniques can also help some patients in addition to the first line treatment."

Both of these substances are carcinogenic, which means they contain chemicals that can damage the DNA in cells and lead to cancer. The risk of mouth cancer increases significantly in somebody who is both a heavy smoker and heavy drinker.\r\nBetel nuts\r\nBetel nuts are mildly addictive seeds taken from the betel palm tree, and are widely used in many southeast Asian communities, such as people of Indian and Sri Lankan origin.\r\nThey have a stimulant effect similar to coffee. Betel nuts also have a carcinogenic effect, which can increase the risk of mouth cancer. This risk is made worse as many people enjoy chewing betel nuts along with tobacco.\r\nDue to the tradition of using betel nuts, rates of mouth cancer are much higher in ethnic Indian and Sri Lankan communities than in the population at large.\r\nSmokeless tobacco\r\nSmokeless tobacco is a general term used to refer to a range of products, such as:\r\n\r\nChewing tobacco\r\nSnuff \u2013 powdered tobacco designed to be snorted\r\nSnus \u2013 a type of smokeless tobacco popular in Sweden, which is placed under your upper lip, where it is gradually absorbed into your blood.\r\n\r\nCannabis\r\nSmoking cannabis has also been linked to an increased risk of mouth cancer. Regular cannabis smokers may have a higher risk than tobacco smokers because cannabis smoke contains higher levels of tar than tobacco smoke, and tar is carcinogenic.\r\nHuman papilloma virus (HPV)\r\nThe human papilloma virus (HPV) is the name of a family of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes that line your body, such as those in your cervix, anus, mouth and throat.\r\nInfection with some types of HPV can cause abnormal tissue growth and other changes to the cells, which can lead to the development of cancer\r\nPoor oral hygiene\r\nThere is evidence that poor oral hygiene, such as having tooth decay, gum disease, not brushing your teeth regularly and having ill-fitted dentures (false teeth) can increase your risk of mouth cancer."

After the menopause, the level of estrogen in the body falls, and this can lead to a rapid decrease in bone density.\r\nMen\r\nIn most of the men who develop osteoporosis, the cause is unknown. However, there is a link to the male hormone testosterone, which helps to keep the bones healthy. Men continue to produce this hormone into old age, but the risk of osteoporosis is increased in men with low levels of testosterone.\r\nDiseases of the hormone-producing glands There are increased chances of Osteoporosis by hormone-related diseases, including:\r\n\r\nHyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland)\r\nDisorders of the adrenal glands, such as Cushing's syndrome\r\nReduced amounts of sex hormones (oestrogen and testosterone)\r\nDisorders of the pituitary gland\r\nHyperparathyroidism (overactivity of the parathyroid glands).\r\n\r\nOther things thought to increase the risk of osteoporosis and broken bones include:\r\n\r\nFamily history of osteoporosis\r\nA low body mass index (BMI) of 19 or less\r\nLong-term use of high-dose corticosteroid treatment (widely used for conditions such as arthritis and asthma), which can affect bone strength\r\nHeavy drinking and smoking\r\nRheumatoid arthritis"

Diagnosis can be made on suspicion when patient approaches a doctor for any other reason or x-ray is done otherwise and bones appear weak.\r\nConventional radiography\r\nConventional radiography is used either alone or in conjunction with CT or MRI, for detecting complications of osteopenia (reduced bone mass preosteoporosis). However, radiography is relatively insensitive to detection of early disease and requires a substantial amount of bone loss (about 30%) to be apparent on X-ray images. The main radiographic features of generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency. Involvement of multiple vertebral bodies leads to kyphosis of the thoracic spine, leading to what is known as dowager's hump.\r\nDual-energy X-ray\r\nDual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the bone mineral density is less than or equal to 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young (30\u201340-year-old) healthy adult women reference population. This is translated as a T-score.\r\nBiomarkers\r\nChemical biomarkers are a useful tool in detecting bone degradation. The enzyme cathepsin K breaks down type-I collagen protein, an important constituent in bones. Antibodies recognizes the resulting fragment, called a neoepitope, as a way to diagnose osteoporosis. Increased urinary excretion of C-telopeptides, a type-I collagen breakdown product, also serves as a biomarkers for osteoporosis."

                "Orbital dermoid is a congenital benign cystic teratoma (choristoma) that originates from aberrant ectodermal tissue. In these tumours, there is embryonic displacement of epidermis to a subcutaneous location along embryonic lines of closure. As two suture lines of skull close during embryonic development, epidermal or dermal elements may pinch off and form cysts. Orbital dermoids are not attached to the skin.\r\nOrbital dermoid may appear as:\r\nDermoid cyst: Dermoid cysts have a fibrous wall and are lined by keratinised stratified squamous epithelium and contain dermal appendages such as sweat glands, hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Dermoid cyst may be:-\r\n- Superficial dermoid cyst: Superficial dermoid cysts are located anterior to the orbital septum (anatomic boundary between lid and orbital tissue). These are more common than deep dermoid cysts and become apparent during first decade of life.\r\n- Deep dermoid cysts: Deep dermoid cysts are located posterior to the orbital septum. Deep dermoid cysts appear typically in adolescence or adult life.\r\nEpidermoid cyst: Epidermoid cysts, unlike dermoid cysts, do not contain adnexal structures (accessory visual structures) such as hair follicles, sweat glands or sebaceous glands."

It may be mobile or affixed to the bone. It may induce granulomatous inflammation in adjacent tissues, if it leaks or ruptures. Large cysts may cause mechanical ptosis.\r\nDeep dermoid cyst:\r\nDeep dermoid cyst present typically in adolescence or adult life with ocular displacement and non-axial proptosis or a mass lesion with indistinct posterior margins. Deep orbital dermoids may be palpable or non-palpable. Some deep dermoids may extend into temporalis fossa or intracranially. These dermoids may be associated with bony defects. Deep dermoids may cause progressive proptosis or diplopia.\r\n\r\nClinical signs: \r\nDermoid may show following signs:-\r\n- Palpable mass.\r\n- Non-axial proptosis.\r\n- Ptosis of eye lid.\r\n- Restricted eyeball movements.\r\n- Diplopia may be due to restriction of eyeball movement or due to compression of cranial nerves controlling movement of eyeball viz. IIIrd, IVth or VIth.\r\n- Inflammation.\r\n- Orbito-cutaneous fistula.\r\n- Optic nerve compression leading to reduced visual acuity, colour vision and brightness perception. There may be relative afferent pupillary defect.\r\nImaging studies:\r\nRadiography:\r\nX-rays may show radiolucent bony defects due to erosion by the cyst. These defects may be large with distinct margins and may show sclerosis.\r\nCT scan:\r\nOn CT scan, cyst lumen is generally homogeneous but it can also be heterogeneous depending upon the amount of lipid and keratin within it. Lumen does not show enhancement with use of contrast.\r\nMagnetic Resonance imaging (MRI):\r\nMRI shows cystic appearance, internal fat attenuation (on T1 hyperintensity), internal calcification, and fluid levels. Cyst wall shows enhancement but not the lumen with gadolinium based contrast. Dermoids are high in signal intensity on MRI diffusion-weighted imaging.\r\nUltrasonography:\r\nOn ultrasound, dermoid cysts show a smooth contour and variable echogenicity.\r\nColour Doppler imaging:\r\nColour Doppler imaging of dermoid cyst shows absence of intralesional blood flow.\r\n\r\nHistological features:\r\nDermoid cyst wall has variable thickness and may be very thin. Cyst may be connected to periorbita by fibrovascular tissue. Epidermoid cysts are lined by epithelial cells. Dermoid cysts contain adnexal tissue such as sebaceous gland and hair follicles. Cyst may contain oily liquid or solid mass, often high in cholesterol. The cysts may be inflamed.\r\nThe dermoid cyst should be differentiated from conditions like:-\r\n- Congenital encephalocele.\r\n- Mucocele.\r\n- Dacryocele.\r\n- Lateral dermoid cyst should be distinguished from lacrimal gland tumours.\r\n- Exophthalmos (protrusion of eyeball).\r\n- Compressive optic neuropathy.\r\n- Orbital tumours.\r\n-    Sebaceous gland carcinoma."

                "Ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a complication of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), where an immunologic response by donor cells against host tissues occurs due to incompatibility between the recipient and donor cells. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a common treatment for haematologic, immunologic, metabolic and neoplastic diseases. HSCT is limited due to GVHD, which is a major cause of morbidity following allogeneic HSCT. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) markers are the most important factors, triggering the immune response and leading to the onset of GVHD.\r\nTypes of transplantation depend upon the source of donor cells, though it is covered under the term bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Sources include autologous (from self), syngeneic (genetically identical), and allogeneic (other individual). The donor cells may be harvested not only from bone marrow but also from peripheral blood and blood from the placental cord.\r\nGVHD is an immune response by the donor cells (graft) against the recipient (host), resulting in an immunological attack against organ systems.\r\nTissues most commonly targeted by donor cells include:\r\n\r\nGastrointestinal system.\r\nLiver.\r\nSkin.\r\nMouth.\r\nLungs.\r\nEyes.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, based on the time of onset, GVHD has been characterised as:\r\n\r\nAcute.\r\nChronic.\r\n\r\nAcute GVHD occurs within the first hundred days after HSCT, while chronic GVHD occurs after that time. Ocular complications are most commonly associated with chronic GVHD.\r\nThis hundred days separation between acute and chronic held true in the myeloablative era (Myeloablative means killing of cells in bone marrow by chemotherapy or radiotherapy), but it was seen that non- myeloablative allogeneic HSCT and reduced intensity conditioning were associated with a two month delay in onset of acute GVHD, while acute and chronic GVHDs were found to present simultaneously in patients treated, for example, with lymphocyte infusions. Thus, with current consensus, it is primarily the clinical manifestations and not the time of onset of symptoms after transplant that determines the classification of GVHD as acute or chronic.\r\nThe prevalence of GVHD varies depending upon:\r\n\r\nAge.\r\nDonor cell compatibility.\r\nProphylaxis measures.\r\nHost environment."

The primary cell responsible for this attack are the donor T-helper type 1 cells in acute GVHD and the donor T-helper type 2 cells in chronic GVHD.\r\nWhile the mechanism behind chronic GVHD has not been fully elucidated, there is a decreased tolerance to self- antigens and inflammatory reactions in multiple organ systems.\r\nConjunctivitis is commonly observed as a localised ocular reaction in GVHD. Although the mechanism is not understood, flow cytometry has demonstrated the proliferation of T cells in subconjunctival immunogenic inflammation. Histopathology has revealed lymphocyte exocytosis and satellitosis, dyskeratotic cells, epithelial cell necrosis, sub-epithelial micro-vesicle formation and eventually, total separation of the epithelium in the conjunctiva of patients with GVHD. Epithelial attenuation and goblet cell depletion have also been reported.\r\nIn GVHD, donor lymphocytes infiltrate the lacrimal gland, leading to widespread fibrosis and aqueous tear deficiency. Histopathology of the lacrimal gland in patients with chronic GVHD and DES reveals Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) - positive material accumulation in the acini and ductules, predominant T-cell infiltration in periductal areas, increased number and activation of stromal fibroblasts and excessive extracellular matrix fibrosis. There is also prominent fibrosis of the glandular interstitium, similar to the chronic skin GVHD changes with generalised sclera-dermal lichenoid. Autopsy studies of the lacrimal gland in patients with GVHD have shown stasis of lacrimal gland secretions and epithelial cell debris within the lumina. Immunohistochemical studies show primarily CD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) and CD8 T-cell infiltration in periductal area of lacrimal glands of patients with chronic GVHD.\r\nMeibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) can also lead to dry eye symptoms in patients with GVHD.

Essential components of the history include extent of systemic GVHD, as well as systemic medications taken.\r\nOcular GVHD may have clinical manifestations similar to those of autoimmune and collagen vascular diseases affecting the eye, but ocular GVHD does not typically affect the posterior chamber (extremely rare).\r\nOcular GVHD affects 60-90% of patients with chronic systemic GVHD and may be the initial presentation of systemic GVHD. Ocular manifestations vary widely from mild findings, to severe ocular sequelae and can affect the eyelid, lacrimal gland, conjunctiva, tear film, cornea, lens, vitreous, retina and optic nerve.\r\nMost common presentation includes diseases of the ocular surface and lacrimal gland.\r\nAppropriate diagnosis and management of ocular GVHD is important in order to maintain visual acuity and good quality of life in cases treated with HSCT.\r\nDry eye syndrome (DES) or keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS)occurs in 70% of GVHD patients.\r\nBesides the symptoms of dryness, irritation, blurred vision, photophobia, redness and mucous discharge, patient may have any of the following signs:\r\n\r\nFeatures of dry eye.\r\nLacrimal gland dysfunction.\r\nSpontaneous lacrimal punctal occlusion (SLPO).\r\nCicatricial ectropion.\r\nCicatricial entropion.\r\nTrichiasis.\r\nMeibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)\r\nConjunctival inflammation and fibrosis.\r\nCicatricial lagophthalmos. \r\nSterile conjunctivitis.\r\nConjunctival oedema or chemosis.\r\nPseudomembrane formation.\r\nPunctate keratopathy.\r\nCorneal epithelial erosions.\r\nCorneal infections.\r\nChronic filamentary keratitis.\r\nCorneal scarring.\r\nCalcareous corneal degeneration.\r\nCorneal ulceration.\r\nCorneal perforation.\r\nUveitis.\r\nSynechiae.\r\nCataract.\r\nRetinal vasculitis.\r\nRetinal haemorrhage.\r\nOptic neuropathy.\r\n\r\n\r\nClassification:\r\nMultiple classification systems have been used to categorise ocular GVHD.\r\nIn 1989, Jabs et al. proposed a clinical staging system for conjunctival involvement in ocular GVHD.\r\nClinical Staging System for Conjunctivitis in Ocular GVHD (Jabs et al. 1989):\r\n\r\nStage I: Hyperaemia.\r\nStage II: Hyperaemia with chemosis and/or serosanguineous exudates.\r\nStage III: Pseudo-membranous/membranous conjunctivitis.\r\nStage IV: Pseudo-membranous/membranous conjunctivitis with corneal epithelial sloughing.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, Kiang et al. characterised the course of ocular GVHD into four stages.\r\nStages of Ocular GVHD (Kiang et al. 1998):\r\n\r\nStage 1 or Subclinical stage: Tearing, mild nonspecific discomfort and photophobia. Mild chemosis, possible rose bengal staining. It lasts from a few days up to 1 month before other systemic symptoms of GVHD occur or the patient progresses to a more severe form of ocular GVHD.\r\nStage 2 or Active stage: Muco-purulent conjunctivitis. Pseudo-membranous conjunctivitis, punctate keratitis or corneal abrasion. Patients usually have systemic manifestations of GVHD.\r\nStage 3 or Convalescent stage: Secondary sicca. Irregular eyelid margins with obstructed meibomian gland orifices, tarsal and forniceal scarring and punctate corneal epitheliopathy.\r\nStage 4 or Necrotising stage: Corneal melting and possible corneal perforation.\r\n\r\nAn alternative classification system was proposed by Robinson et al. in 2004. In this system, clinically relevant grading criteria for conjunctival GVHD is based on conjunctival pathology, observed in chronic GVHD patients.\r\nClinical Grading Criteria for Conjunctival GVHD (Robinson et al. 2004):\r\n\r\nGrade 1: Conjunctival hyperaemia occurring on the bulbar or palpebral conjunctiva in at least one eyelid.\r\nGrade 2: Palpebral conjunctival fibro-vascular changes occurring along the superior border of the upper eyelid, or the lower border of the tarsal plate of the lower eyelid, with or without conjunctival epithelial sloughing, involving &lt;25% of the total surface area in at least one eyelid.\r\nGrade 3: Palpebral conjunctival fibro-vascular changes occurring along the superior border of the upper eyelid, or the lower border of the tarsal plate of the lower eyelid, involving 25- 75% of the total surface area in at least one eyelid.\r\nGrade 4: Palpebral conjunctival fibro-vascular changes involving &gt;75% of the total surface area with or without a cicatricial entropion in at least one eyelid.\r\n\r\n\r\nClinical tests: \r\n\r\nSchirmer test: Schirmer test assists in diagnosis of lacrimal function in chronic ocular GVHD. New onset KCS with Schirmer score of 6-10mm or a symptomatic patient with Schirmer score of \u00b1 5mm in presence of other organ involvement forms the criteria for diagnosis of chronic ocular GVHD.\r\nOcular surface disease index (OSDI): Ocular surface disease index (OSDI) is shown to be statistically higher in patients with chronic ocular GVHD than in pre-transplant or post-transplant patients without ocular GVHD (Agomo et al. 2008).\r\nVideokeratoscope: Videokeratoscope may be used in the evaluation of patients with higher aberrations in patients of chronic GVHD (Chang-Strepka 2009).\r\n\r\n\r\nHistopathology: \r\nHistopathology of the conjunctival biopsy may reveal lymphocyte exocytosis and satellitosis, dyskeratotic cells, epithelial cell necrosis, sub-epithelial micro-vesicle formation and eventual total separation of the epithelium in the conjunctiva of patients with GVHD.\r\n\r\nDiagnostic criteria:\r\nThe diagnostic criteria for ocular GVHD were established by the National institutes of Health Consensus Development Project on Criteria for Clinical Trials in Chronic GVHD in 2005. The Diagnosis and Staging Working Group has stated that a mean Schirmer value of 5mm at 5 minutes or new onset of keratoconjunctivitis sicca by slit lamp examination, with a mean Schirmer value of 6- 10mm, is sufficient for the diagnosis of Chronic GVHD, if accompanied by involvement of at least one other organ system.\r\nThe NIH Health Consensus Development Project defined findings of new-onset dry, gritty, or painful eyes, cicatricial conjunctivitis, KCS, and confluent areas of punctuate keratopathy, as well as periorbita hyper-pigmentation, difficulty in opening the eyes in the morning because of dried mucoid secretions, and blepharitis as \u2018distinctive signs\u2019 (seen in chronic GVHD but insufficient, alone, to establish a diagnosis of chronic GVHD). As per report, a diagnosis of chronic GVHD could be made in the presence of one diagnostic sign or the presence of a distinctive sign (confirmed by biopsy and laboratory testing) and/or distinctive signs in one other organ system. This formed the basis for the addition of two new categories to the existing classification of GVHD: persistent, recurrent, or late-onset acute GVHD (&gt;3 months) and overlap syndrome (no temporal relation) in which features of acute and chronic GVHD appear together. Chronic GVHD based only on ocular findings (presence of one distinctive sign) can be confirmed on the basis of biopsy evidence of KCS or Schirmer test and if accompanied by distinctive manifestations in at least one other organ. Routine screening biopsy serves little benefit for early detection of ocular GVHD. Lacrimal gland biopsy is invasive and risks decreasing the functional capacity of the gland.\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis:\r\nDue to similar clinical features, ocular GVHD should be differentiated from:\r\n\r\nAutoimmune diseases.\r\nCollagen vascular diseases."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nA multidisciplinary approach that incorporates collaboration with other medical teams is essential for GVHD patients. This includes collaboration with the haematology and oncology services and stem cell transplantation services.\r\nThe management of ocular GVHD includes:\r\nI. Primary prevention\r\nII. Secondary therapeutic approaches which includes medical, both local and systemic, and surgical therapies.\r\nI. Primary prevention:\r\nPrevention of disease plays an important role in decreasing the morbidity associated with ocular GVHD.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental modifications: Environmental modifications and decreased exposure to low-humidity settings may reduce DES symptoms. Cool mist humidifiers can be particularly helpful for environmental modifications at home, including bedside use while sleeping.\r\nUltraviolet light exposure: Minimising ultraviolet light exposure also helps.\r\nEye evaluation: Regular eye evaluation may monitor for the development of infection, cataract, and intraocular pressure elevation. Therefore, a thorough ocular exam is recommended prior to HSCT.\r\nTopical cyclosporine: Prophylactic use of topical cyclosporine (0.05%) might also reduce severity of disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Secondary therapeutic approaches:\r\n1. Systemic medical therapy:\r\n\r\nImmunosuppression: Systemic immunosuppressive medications may be effective in preventing manifestations of GVHD, but this benefit must also be weighed against the associated risks of infection, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, hypertension, and even death. Agents include tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, methotrexate, sirolimus, antithymocyte globulin, Ultraviolet (UV) light therapy and corticosteroids. These systemic therapies are often reserved for severe or refractory cases, due to long term adverse events with chronic use. First-line treatments are instead targeted towards specific organ systems with ocular immunosuppressive agents. \r\n\r\n2. Local medical therapy:\r\nSuccessful treatment modalities include eye lubrication, reduction of tear evaporation, minimising ocular surface inflammation, and immunosuppression.\r\na. Lubrication and Reduction of Tear evaporation:\r\n\r\nPreservative-free artificial tears: Preservative-free artificial tears and ophthalmic lubricating ointments are effective approaches in providing lubrication and diluting inflammatory mediators in the tear film.\r\nPunctal occlusion: Punctal occlusion may effectively decrease tear drainage from the ocular surface, with either silicone plugs as temporary measure or permanent thermal cauterisation.\r\nMoisture chamber goggles: Moisture chamber goggles may also prove beneficial in reducing tear evaporation and increasing patient comfort.\r\nTreatment of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD): Dry eyes may be exacerbated by dysfunction of Meibomian and Zeis glands, both of which normally serve to produce the outer lipid layer of the tear film. The lipid layer is crucial in minimising evaporation of tears from the corneal surface. Treatment involves:\r\n\r\n- Warm compresses.\r\n- Lid Hygiene.\r\n- Oral tetracyclines or azithromycin.\r\nb. Minimising ocular surface inflammation and immunosuppression:\r\n\r\nTopical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroid reduces ocular surface inflammation. The mechanism of action is through lymphocyte apoptosis (programmed cell death without releasing harmful substances into the surrounding area) and blockage of cell-mediated inflammation. Topical steroids are often combined with prophylactic topical antibiotic and tapered to avoid potential side effects. Patient is monitored for corticosteroid-induced side effects. They are contraindicated in patients with infiltrates, epithelial defects or stromal thinning of the cornea.\r\nTopical cyclosporine A: Topical cyclosporine A is an anti-inflammatory drug, which produces local inhibition of T lymphocytes and cytokine production in the conjunctiva. Cyclosporine may minimise destruction of lacrimal gland tissue and reduce dry eye. There may be improvement in corneal sensitivity, tear evaporation rate, tear break-up time, vital staining scores, goblet cell density, conjunctival squamous metaplasia and inflammatory cell numbers after treatment with topical cyclosporine. This has been used primarily in patients of chronic GVHD and KCS with minimal improvement, despite treatment with lubrication and topical steroids.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. Autologous serum eye drops: Autologous serum eye drops (20-50%) have been used safely and effectively in the treatment of DES in patients with ocular GVHD. Unlike artificial tears, they contain albumin, epidermal growth factor, fibronectin, vitamin A, neurotrophic growth factor, and hepatocyte growth factor, all of which may help in maintaining stable tear film. A potential concern with this treatment is the risk of contamination which may produce infection.\r\nd. Scleral contact lenses: Scleral contact lenses have also been used in patients with severe or refractory dry eye disease. These larger contact lenses create a tear-filled vault on the corneal surface without corneal contact. These include Jupiter lenses, as well as the custom-designed PROSE (Prosthestic Replacement of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem) lenses.\r\ne. Mucolytic agents: Mucolytic agents such as acetylcysteine (10%) may be used to treat severe filamentary keratitis.\r\nf. Newer treatment modalities: Newer agents include topical immunomodulator tranilast (rizaben), topical tacrolimus, and retinoic acid, although large scale studies are needed.\r\n\r\n3. Surgical therapy:\r\nSurgical therapy may be needed in most severe cases of GVHD where maximal medical therapy may fail in reducing symptoms and protecting the ocular surface.\r\n\r\nTarsorrhaphy: Tarsorrhaphy may be required to protect the ocular surface. Tarsorrhaphy may be performed with suture, glue adhesive, or botulinum toxin. Suture is the best technique as most patients with severe GVHD require a permanent tarsorrhaphy.\r\nAmniotic membrane grafting: Amniotic membrane grafting may be done to protect the corneal surface. Amniotic membrane may be placed with suture or fibrin glue in one or multiple layers, or in conjunction with a carrier, such as with bio-tissue ProKera or AmbioDisc.\r\nCyanoacrylate glue patching: Cyanoacrylate glue patching may be performed in small descemetoceles or corneal perforations.\r\nDeep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK): Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) may be done for large descemetocele.\r\nPenetrating keratoplasty (PK): Penetrating keratoplasty (PK) may also be performed for large descemetocele. In patients with large corneal perforations, penetrating keraoplasty must be performed on an emergency basis with strong consideration of placement of a concurrent tarsorrhaphy and/or amniotic membrane graft.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nOcular involvement, though rare in systemic acute GVHD, is considered a poor prognostic factor for mortality caused by systemic acute GVHD. Though known to impair the quality of life and activities of daily living, ocular GVHD usually does not lead to permanent visual loss."

                "Obesity is a condition where a person has accumulated abnormal or excessive body fat that causes negative effects on health. For an individual, obesity is usually the result of an imbalance between calories consumed and calories expanded. An increased consumption of high calorie foods, without an equal increase in physical activity leads to an increase in weight. Decreased levels of physical activity will also result in an energy imbalance and lead to weight gain. \r\nOnce it was thought as a problem of high income countries now the problem of overweight and obesity are increasing in low income and middle income countries especially in urban areas. Since 1980 obesity has doubled worldwide. In 2014 more than 1.9 billion adults (18 years and older) and 41 million children under the age of five were overweight. Nearly half of the children under five who were overweight or obese in 2014 lived in Asia.\r\nOverweight and obesity are emerging health problems in India. According to National family health survey India-3 (NFHS-3), thirteen percent of women (15-49 Years) and nine percent of men (15-49 Years) were overweight or obese in 2005-06. Overweight prevalence was higher in urban areas than rural areas and lower in people who are involved in agriculture or manual work.\r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) defines overweight and obesity as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A simple measure commonly used to classify overweight and obesity in adults is body mass index (BMI). BMI is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2). WHO identifies overweight when BMI is greater than or equal to 25; and obesity when BMI is greater or equal to 30. In Asians, the cut-offs for overweight (\u226523.0kg/m2) and obesity (\u226525.0kg/m2) are lower than WHO criteria due to risk factors and morbidities.\r\nOverweight and obesity kills more people than underweight and act as a predisposing factor for non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (heart attack and stroke), diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders (osteoarthritis), some cancers (including breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney, and colon).\r\nObesity during childhood also causes breathing difficulties, increased risk of fractures, hypertension, and psychological effects. In later life with high chances of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes can lead to disability and premature death.\r\nOverweight, obesity and their related non-communicable disease are preventable. By making the choice of healthier food and regular physical activity overweight and obesity can be prevented."

                "Obesity doesn't occur overnight. It develops gradually over time when there is disturbance in energy balance. Energy balance means that \u201cenergy in\u201d through food intake and \u201cenergy out\u201d through physical activities. Consuming excess calories from high-fat foods, sugars and doing little or no daily physical activity over the long time will lead to weight gain. The reasons for the imbalance between calorie intake and energy out may vary from individual to individual.\r\n\r\nGenetics may play a role in conversion of food into energy and how body burns calories during exercise. Genes may affect the amount of fat storage and distribution of fat in body.\r\nFamily history- A person is more likely to develop obesity if one or both parents are obese. Overweight and obesity tend to run in families not just because of genetics but family members tend to share similar eating and activity habits. Children\u2019s choices, diet and physical activity habits are influenced by their surrounding environment.\r\nUnhealthy diet- Diet rich in calories (fast foods), high calorie beverages, oversized portions, bad eating habits (eating between meals, preference to sweets, refined foods, and fats), diet lacking with fruits and vegetables; all these factors contribute to weight gain.\r\nSedentary life style- With a sedentary lifestyle such as sedentary occupation and inactive recreation (watching television) more calories are stored in the body every day than used through exercise. Thus sedentary lifestyle promotes weight gain. If there is any associated medical problems such as arthritis can lead to decreased activity; that contributes to weight gain.\r\nHealth conditions- Some medical conditions may cause over weight and obesity because of hormonal disturbances such as hypothyroidism, Cushing\u2019s syndrome and poly cystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\r\n\r\nIn hypothyroidism there is lack of thyroid hormone that slows down the metabolism and causes weight gain.\r\nPCOS is a condition that affects women of child bearing age. It is often associated with obesity due to high levels of androgens.\r\nIn Cushing syndrome there is increased production of cortisol hormone from adrenal glands.\r\n\r\nMedicines-Certain medicines such as corticosteroids, antidepressants and medicines used for seizure control may cause weight gain.\r\nEmotional factors- For some people, eating habits are influenced by emotions such as sadness, stress, boredom or anger and they react by eating excessively.\r\nSmoking- Quitting smoking is often associated with weight gain. However, smoking is a serious health risk, and quitting is more important than possible weight gain.\r\nAge- Obesity can occur at any age, even in young children. Infants with excessive weight have increased chances of obesity in later life. As age increases, muscle mass tends to decrease and some hormonal changes also occur; these factors along with less active lifestyle increase the risk of obesity in later age.\r\nSex-Men have more muscle mass and use more calories (even at rest) than women. Thus, women are more likely to gain weight as compare to men with the same calorie intake; however midlife weight gain in women is mainly due to aging and lifestyle, but at menopause hormonal changes also play a role in weight gain.\r\nPregnancy- Woman gain weight during pregnancy and, some women find it difficult to lose weight after child birth. This weight gain may contribute to the development of obesity in women.\r\nLack of sleep- Not having enough sleep or getting too much sleep can cause changes in hormones that may increase appetite and craving for foods high in calories and carbohydrates, which can contribute to weight gain.\r\nEnvironment- If environment doesn\u2019t support healthy lifestyle, it encourages obesity. Some reasons include-\r\n\r\nLack of neighborhood sidewalks, parks, and safe places for recreation prevents people to be physically active.\r\nPeople working with long work hours and time spent commuting don\u2019t have enough time to be physically active.\r\nLack of access to healthy foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, or, for some people these healthy foods are too costly.\r\nLack of awareness about healthy diet and healthy cooking practices.\r\nFood advertisements for high-calorie, high-fat snacks and sugary drinks promote people to buy them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two different kinds of distribution of body fat that play a role in determining risk of obesity \u2013related health problems;\r\n\r\nexcess body fat distributed around the waist (apple-shaped figure, intra-abdominal fat);\r\nexcess body fat distributed on the hips and thighs (pear-shaped figure, fat under the skin)\r\n\r\nFat collected around the waist (apple-shaped figure) carries more risk for obesity related health problems."

                "(a) Assessment of obesity\r\nHeight and weight are the most simple and commonly used measures. Overweight and obesity can be diagnosed by calculating body mass index (BMI) of an individual. BMI generally correlates with fat accumulation although it can sometimes misclassify total body fat content as seen in athletes who are muscular, have high BMI due to muscle weighing more than fat and will have BMI within the overweight range even though they are not fat. The adult BMI cut-offs are not considered appropriate for children as they are still growing.\r\nBMI is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2). BMI (Metric Formula) =Weight in Kilograms/Height in meters2 .\r\nWHO defines overweight when BMI is greater than or equal to 25.0kg/m2; and obesity when BMI is greater or equal to 30.0kg/m2. In Asians, the cut-offs for overweight (\u226523.0kg/m2) and obesity (\u226525.0kg/m2) is lower than WHO criteria due to risk factors and morbidities.\r\nWaist circumference: It is measured at the midpoint between the lower border of the rib cage and the iliac crest. Waist circumference \u2265102 cm in men and \u226588cm in females is associated with an increased risk of metabolic complications.\r\nWaist: Hip ratio (WHR): High WHR (&gt;1.0 in men and &gt;0.85 in women) indicates abdominal fat accumulation.\r\n(b) Obese persons should have a full medical assessment including routine evaluation of co-morbidity such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia. A cardiovascular examination is needed for those older than 40 years or persons having history of heart disease.\r\n(c) Various laboratory tests may be performed to assess co- morbid conditions-\r\n\r\nFasting lipid profile\r\nLiver function tests\r\nThyroid function tests\r\nFasting glucose and haemoglobin A1c(HBA1c)"

                "For most people who are overweight or obese, the safest and most effective way to lose weight is setting goals with life style changes such as eating fewer calories and being physically active. If lifestyle changes are not enough then only medicines and weight loss surgery are options. While suffering from any co-morbid condition such as diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis consult your physician prior to starting life style changes.\r\nSet realistic goals:\r\n\r\nThe best way to lose weight is decrease it slowly. A weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds a week is safe and will give the time to adopt new healthy life style changes. Hence 5-10 percent of current body weight can be loosed over six months time.\r\nIf a child in the family is overweight or obese the focus should be to encourage him for healthy eating habits and physical activity and if any health condition related to overweight or obesity is present, pediatrician should be consulted.\r\n\r\n(a) Life style changes:\r\nLife style changes include healthy eating habits and physical activity.\r\n(i) Healthy eating habits provide body the sufficient nutrients for maintaining good health, but not so many that it causes weight gain.Healthy diet includes:\r\n\r\nLimit energy intake from total fats and shift fat consumption away from saturated fats to unsaturated fats and towards the elimination of trans-fatty acids. This can be achieved by-\r\n\r\neating fat-free and low-fat dairy products, such as low-fat yogurt, cheese, and milk\r\navoiding whole milk, whole-milk cheese, cream, butter, and ice cream\r\navoiding foods containing solid fats(vanaspati ghee, lard, coconut, and palm oils) such as deep fried fast foods\r\nLimiting foods prepared with partially hydrogenated oils (Doughnuts, cookies, crackers, muffins, pies and cakes)\r\nLimiting use of ground beef, sausage, and processed meats\r\n\r\nconsume whole-grain foods (whole-wheat bread and chapati, oatmeal, and brown rice), legumes and nuts\r\nincrease consumption of fruits and vegetables\r\nlimit the intake of free sugars\r\nlimit salt (sodium) consumption from all sources and ensure that salt is iodized.\r\n\r\nPortion size: Cutting back on portion size is a good way to eat fewer calories. Avoid oversized portions. Use a smaller plate, bowl, and glass.\r\nFood weight: Eat foods that are lower in calories and fat for a given amount of food; for example; replacing a full-fat food product that weighs two ounces with a low-fat product that weighs the same. Another helpful practice is to eat foods that contain a lot of water, such as vegetables, fruits, and soups.\r\nVery-low-calorie diet (VLCD): gives less than 800 calories a day. Though these diets can lead to rapid weight loss, butthey aren't a safe method for everyone. VLCDs are only recommended when obesity-related complication would need rapid weight loss.\r\n(ii) Physical activity- This is an important part of weight reducing programme. Regular physical exercise is essential to increase energy expenditure. Few important suggestions are-\r\n\r\nConsult the physician before starting physical activity specially those who are having other medical problems along with obesity.\r\nStart physical activity slowly and increase intensity and duration gradually with time. Low to medium intensity is sufficient. It is not necessary to participate in strenuous activity.\r\nChoose activities that you enjoy and that fit into your daily life.\r\nStart activity with doing more everyday activities, such as taking the stairs instead of elevators and doing house hold chores.\r\nThe next step is to start walking, biking, or swimming at a slow pace and increase the exercise time, or increase the intensity level of the activity gradually. (Brisk walk, dancing, gardening, and water aerobics are moderate-intensity physical activity).\r\n\r\n(iii) Behavioral changes-Changing behaviors or habits related to food and physical activity is important for losing weight such as:\r\n\r\nChange the habits promoting weight gain such as watching television for long hours.\r\nKeep a record of your weight loss.\r\nAsk for help or encouragement from friends, family, and health care provider.\r\nReward the success for meeting weight-loss goals.\r\n\r\n(b)Prescription anti-obesity drugs can be useful adjuncts to diet and exercise for obese adults who have failed to achieve weight loss with diet and exercise. Drugs are only prescribed when BMI is 28 kg/m2 or more with other weight related conditions or BMI 30 kg/m2 or more.\r\n(c)Weight loss surgery-also called bariatric surgery, is sometimes used to treat people who are severely obese (for BMI of 35 kg/m2 with co-morbidity or BMI over 40 kg/m2). Common weight-loss surgeries include:\r\n\r\nGastric bypass surgery\r\nLaparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB)\r\nBiliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch\r\nGastric sleeve\r\n\r\n(d)Vagal nerve blockade is another treatment for obesity. It involves implanting a device under the skin of the abdomen that sends intermittent electrical pulses to the abdominal vagus nerve, which tells the brain when the stomach feels empty or full. This new technology is used in adults who have not been able to lose weight with a weight-loss programme and who have a BMI of 35 - 45 kg/m2 with at least one obesity-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes."

                "Osteoarthrithis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis in both developed and developing countries. It is a chronic, progressive musculoskeletal disorder characterized by gradual loss of cartilage in joints which results in bones rubbing together and creating stiffness, pain, and impaired movement. The disease most commonly affects the joints in the knees, hips, hands, feet, and spine. The disease is associated with modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors such as obesity, lack of exercise, genetic predisposition, bone density, occupational injury, trauma, and gender.\r\nOsteoarthritis can be classified into two groups primary and secondary. Primary osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative disease and is related to aging. The water content of the cartilages decreases on increasing age, thus making them more susceptible to degradation. While secondary arthritis usually affects the joints earlier in life due to specific causes such as injury during a job requiring frequent kneeling or squatting for long duration, diabetes and obesity.\r\nOsteoarthritis primarily affects the elderly population. It is a major cause of disability in older adults worldwide. According to World Health Organization (WHO) 9.6% of men and 18.0% of women ageds over 60 years have symptomatic osteoarthritis worldwide. 80% of those with osteoarthritis have limitations in movement, and 25% cannot perform their major daily activities of life.\r\nOsteoarthritis is the second most common rheumatologic problem and it is the most frequent joint disease with a prevalence of 22% to 39% in India. OA is more common in women than men. Nearly, 45% of women over the age of 65 years have symptoms while 70% of those over 65 years show radiological evidence of OA.\r\nThe prevalence of OA is increasing due to population ageing and an increase in related factors such as obesity, sedentary life style. The physical disability arising from pain and loss of functional capacity reduces quality of life and increases the risk of further morbidity. As highly effective medicinal management is not available emphasis should be given to preventive aspect of life style measures in the form of healthy diet and exercise."

Management plan should be regularly reviewed which is broadly divided into non-pharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical treatments. Non-pharmacological treatments should be started first, followed by pharmacological treatment and then surgery if the first two are unsuccessful.\r\nAccording to various recommendations, non-pharmacological treatment of OA should include education, exercise, weight reduction and physical aids (such as canes, insoles and knee braces).\r\nEducation-\r\nIt is reported that patient education in disease management, weight reduction and exercise is quite effective in reducing joint pain. Effective educational techniques include individualized education, group education, social support, patient coping skills, and spouse assisted coping skills (coping skills : enhance patients\u2019 ability to control and decrease pain by increasing use of adaptive coping strategies such as distraction, relaxation, and changing activity patterns as pain is affected by thoughts, feelings, and behaviors).\r\nExercise-\r\nExercise is the most important intervention in the management of OA. Exercise builds muscle strength and endurance, improves joint flexibility and motion. Exercise is beneficial even to those patients who are at a healthy weight because increased muscle strength can reduce some of the complications of OA. With the doctor\u2019s advice low impact activities that will not increase the chance of exacerbating symptoms of OA should be encouraged.\r\n\r\nSimple activities like walking around the neighborhood or taking a fun, easy exercise class can reduce pain and help maintain (or attain) a healthy weight.\r\nStrengthening exercises build muscles around OA-affected joints.\r\nStretching: slow, gentle stretching of joints may improve flexibility, decreases stiffness and reduces pain. Exercises such as yoga and tai chi can be practiced to manage stiffness.\r\nRange-of-motion exercise helps maintain and improve joint flexibility and reduce stiffness.\r\nAerobic exercise helps to improve stamina and energy levels and also help to reduce excess weight.\r\n\r\nWeight loss-\r\nOverweight and obese patients with osteoarthritis experience more pain and disability than patients who are not overweight. Excess weight adds additional stress to weight-bearing joints, such as the hips, knees, feet and back. Lifestyle behavioural weight management (BWM) interventions such as eating fewer calories and increasing physical activity should be encouraged to lose weight.\r\nPhysical aids-\r\nOther Non-pharmacological therapy includes a referral to a physical therapist; knee braces, orthotics, and appropriate footwear can reduce pain and improve function in people with poor alignment.\r\nHeat and cold-\r\nHeat or cold (or combination of the two) can be used in OA. Heat can be applied with warm towels, hot packs, or warm bath (it increases blood flow and reduces pain and stiffness). In some cases cold packs can relieve pain or numb the sore area by reducing inflammation.\r\nMassage-\r\nMassage with lightly stroke and /or knead the painful muscles may be a pain relief approach.\r\nApart from the traditional non-pharmacological approaches pulsed ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, electro-acupuncture, and low level laser therapy are newer therapies.\r\nPharmacological therapy-\r\nThe primary strategy for pharmacological management of OA is to control pain and improve function and quality of life for the patient, while limiting drug toxicity as there is no cure for OA.\r\nParacetamol (Acetaminophen): Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a commonly prescribed oral analgesic to treat mild to moderate OA pain.\r\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs can be used for relieving pain in OA (However, treatment with NSAIDs is associated with gastrointestinal effects and potential toxicity, especially in the elderly persons). New classes of NSAIDS called Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX\u20192) inhibitors are also in use (one of the class, refecoxib was found to increase the risk of cardiovascular events and was withdrawn in 2004, celecoxib and eterocoxib are in use). Topical NSAIDs, in the form of cream, patches, gels, solutions, have been found to be effective in reducing pain associated with musculoskeletal conditions, including OA. The benefit of topical NSAIDs is that they eliminate the gastrointestinal side effects of oral treatment. However, they have been associated with certain local adverse effects and they may be less effective than oral NSAIDs.\r\nOpioids may be used for pain relief in patients who cannot use either NSAIDs or acetaminophen; however drug abuse is high with opioids.\r\nIntra-articular corticosteroids: Treatment with corticosteroids injected directly into the joint (intra-articular) has been shown to be effective, especially in OA of the knee.\r\nViscosupplementation: This involves a series of injections of either hyaluronan or hylan products (hyaluronan is a polysaccharide and is one of the main components of the extracellular matrix).\r\nSurgical Management-\r\nJoint replacement surgery: Patients who experience severe pain and show extensive narrowing of joint space and medicines are not effective; these patients are eligible for joint replacement surgery. Joint replacement surgery is removing a damaged joint and putting in an artificial one (A joint is where two or more bones come together, like the knee, hip, and shoulder).\r\nOsteotomy: Osteotomy is the cutting and reshaping of bones with the purpose of altering the area of the joint which bears weight.\r\nArthroscopic debridement and lavage are two processes that involve removing damaged cartilage, bone, and excess debris surrounding the joint."

There may be associated prominent conjunctival vessels. Proptosis may be accentuated or precipitated by dependent head posture or by Valsalva manoeuvre.\r\nIt may be associated with vascular lesions of eyelids or conjunctiva, and may be of arterial or venous origin.\r\nThere may be enophthalmos due to fat atrophy.\r\nIt may show occasional bruising. There may be extensive involvement of peri-orbital or intra-cranial regions.\r\nHistopathology\r\nVarix is seen as one or more dilated veins, frequently with thrombosis and hyalinisation. Thrombosed varix may lead to pathologic reaction showing intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia.\r\n\r\nInvestigations\r\n\r\nX-ray: X-ray may give evidence of calcification due to phlebolith.\r\nCT Imaging: An orbital varix has globular or smooth fusiform appearance, which enhances strongly with contrast medium. It increases in size on Valsalva manoeuvre on dynamic CT scanning.\r\nMRI Imaging: MRI signal depends upon presence of flow within varix. Patent lumen appears as an area of flow void on both T1 and T2-weighted scans. Contrast enhancement is variable and may be absent. Slow flow or thrombus in varix will give it a slight heterogeneous appearance.\r\nA and B-scan ultrasonography: There is increased size of the lesion on ultrasonography.\r\nVenography: This may demonstrate abnormal saccular vessels flowing out through venous channels.\r\nColour Doppler Imaging: This may be used to demonstrate an orbital varix. This is a non-invasive method of investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis\r\nOrbital varix should be distinguished from other vascular lesions of the orbit such as\r\n\r\nHaemangioma.\r\nLymphangioma.\r\nIdiopathic orbital inflammation.\r\nCarotid-cavernous fistula.\r\nDural shunt."

It usually show slow clinical course without vision loss or significant pain. It may occur supero-temporally and may simulate lacrimal gland tumour. It may simultaneously involve orbit and nasal cavity. Occasionally, SFT may be aggressive and can extend to the central nervous system. Malignant transformation and metastasis are rare.\r\n\r\nHistopathology:\r\nHistopathologically, morphology of SFTs varies from highly cellular vascular lesion to fibrous areas with less number of cells. Fibrous matrix contains broad bands of collagen. Characteristic haemangiopericytoma like vascular branching, which is characterised by bifurcating dilated blood vessels with perivascular fibrosis, may be present. There is poor correlation between morphology and malignant potential.\r\nIn most SFTs, immuno-histochemistry shows an intense reactivity for vimentin (protein seen in cells derived from mesenchyme), CD34 and CD99.\r\n\r\nImaging studies:\r\n\r\nCT Orbit: CT orbit shows mild to moderately enhanced well circumscribed mass with or without remodelling of adjacent bone.\r\nMRI: MRI shows intermediate intensity mass on T1-weighted images with moderate enhancement after gadolium. The mass may be hyper or hypo-intense on T2-weighted images. Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) shows hyper-vascular arterial phase blush. MRI is also used for post-operative follow-up of SFT.\r\nUltrasonography: On ultrasonography, tumours show low reflectivity with moderate attenuation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis\r\nSFT needs to be differentiated from\r\n\r\nOrbital haemangiopericytoma\r\nFibrous histiocytoma\r\nNeurofibroma\r\nOptic nerve sheath meningioma\r\nSchwannoma\r\nOrbital metastasis."

Cellular differentiation may be best achieved by electron microscopy and immune-histochemistry.The function of pericytes is uncertain but is believed to provide mechanical support to the capillaries. Pericytes morphologically resemble smooth muscle. Besides the muscle cone of the eye, this tumour may also affect optic nerve meninges and lacrimal sac. This rare tumour is commonly encountered in lower extremities and retro-peritoneum.\r\nMedian age of occurrence is fourth decade, but haemangiopericytoma has been noted from 20 months to 87 years of age. The occurrence of tumour in orbit is more common in males.\r\nOrbital haemangiopericytoma has similar signs and symptoms, and imaging study findings as orbital cavernous haemangioma. The tumour generally present with proptosis, diminution of vision, diplopia, and swelling. However, haemangiopericytoma may be more aggressive, extend throughout in orbit, and may even invade the cranial cavity.

However, it is, sometimes detected later in life following trauma and intralesional haemorrhage. There are two growth patterns of lymphangioma (slow or rapidly explosive). Slow enlargement takes place over decades, producing progressive proptosis. In contrast, explosive growth results from intralesional haemorrhage arising from intrinsic nutrient vessels, or in association with an upper respiratory tract infection with proliferation of lymphoid tissue. In contrast to capillary haemangioma, lymphangiomas do not regress spontaneously. These tumours may become encapsulated due to normal bodily reaction to prevent expansion.\r\nLymphangiomas do not show any connection to the venous system, as has been studied by arteriography or venography. This is in contrast to orbital varix, which usually show connections to the venous system.\r\nLike haemangiomas, Lymphangiomas may present in both superficial and deep orbital spaces. It consists of dilated, thin walled vascular chambers lined with endothelium. Fibrous stroma supports these and contain proteinaceous material reminiscent of lymph.

It may be classified as:\r\nNon pustular\r\n\r\nPsoriasis vulgaris: It is the most common form of psoriasis. It affects 80% to 90% of people with psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis typically appears as raised areas of inflamed skin covered with silvery white scaly skin. These areas are called plaques.\r\nPsoriatic erythroderma: It involves the widespread inflammation and exfoliation of the skin over most of the body surface. It is generally accompanied by severe itching, swelling and pain. This form of psoriasis can be fatal, as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body's ability to regulate temperature and for the skin to perform barrier functions\r\n\r\nPustular\r\nPustular psoriasis appears as raised bumps that are filled with noninfectious pus (pustules). Pustular psoriasis can be localized, commonly to the hands and feet (palmoplantar pustulosis), or generalised with widespread patches occurring randomly on any part of the body. Types include:\r\n\r\nGeneralized pustular psoriasis (pustular psoriasis of von Zumbusch)\r\nPustulosis palmaris et plantaris (persistent palmoplantar pustulosis, pustular psoriasis of the Barber type, pustular psoriasis of the extremities)\r\nAnnular pustular psoriasis\r\nAcrodermatitis continua\r\nImpetigo herpetiformis\r\n\r\nOther Additional types of psoriasis include\r\n\r\nDrug-induced psoriasis\r\nInverse psoriasis.\r\nNapkin psoriasis\r\nSeborrheic-like psoriasis\r\n\r\nGuttate psoriasis: It is characterized by numerous small, scaly, red or pink, teardrop-shaped lesions.\r\nNail psoriasis: It produces a variety of changes in the appearance of finger and toe nails. These changes include discoloring under the nail plate, pitting of the nails, lines going across the nails, thickening of the skin under the nail, and the loosening (onycholysis) and crumbling of the nail.\r\nPsoriatic arthritis: It involves joint and connective tissue inflammation.

It is more likely to occur when the limb is at rest and can be more noticeable when the patient is stressed, anxious or tired.\r\nBradykinesia or slowness of movements: It is another characteristic feature of PD which is associated with difficulties along the course of the movement process, from planning to initiation and finally execution of a movement. Common examples of bradykinesia are slow speed doing a task, difficulty in turning on bed, dressing etc.\r\nMuscle stiffness or rigidity: Stiffness and resistance to limb movement is known as rigidity and is caused by increased muscle tone, an excessive and continuous contraction of muscles.\r\n\r\nRelated to these three major symptoms is gait and posture impairment, which includes freezing of gait, postural instability and falls. Other motor symptoms include:\r\n\r\nMask like face\r\nReduced eye blink\r\nSoft voice\r\nDysphagia\r\nDyskinesia or involuntary muscle cramps.\r\n\r\nIn addition, patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease have several distressing non-motor symptoms.

                "Parkinson's disease/ Parkinsonian syndrome is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra. Nerve cells in this part of the brain are responsible for producing a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine acts as a messenger in the nervous system, and helps control and co-ordinate body movements. If these nerve cells become damaged or die, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced. This means that the part of the brain controlling movement cannot work so well, which causes movements to become slow and abnormal. The loss of nerve cells is a slow process. The level of dopamine in the brain falls over time. Only when 80% of the nerve cells in the substantia nigra have been lost, will the symptoms of Parkinson's disease appear and gradually become more severe. Most people with Parkinson's disease have idiopathic disease (having no specific known cause). Possible factors associated with the Parkinson's disease are:\r\n\r\nFamilial occurrence in small number of patients\r\nEnvironment factors have been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's including:\r\ni. Pesticide exposure\r\nii. Head injuries\r\niii. living in the rural area or farming\r\niv. Air pollution related to road traffic"

In the later stage the patient develops motor complications related to levodopa usage.\r\nTreatment in the initial stage aims for an optimal control between symptoms and side-effectsresulting from improvement of dopaminergic function. The start of levodopa (or L-DOPA) treatment may be delayed by using other medications such as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists, in the hope of delaying the onset of dyskinesias.\r\nIn the second stage the aim is to reduce symptoms while controlling fluctuations of the response to medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed.\r\nSurgery: When medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery and deep brain stimulation can be of use.

It is the effect of poliomyelitis virus on the spinal cord that leads to the classic manifestation of paralysis. Poliomyelitis or poliio is a crippling and potentially deadly infectious disease caused by poliovirus that spreads from person to person invading the brain and spinal cord resulting into paralysis. Humans are the only known reservoir of poliovirus, which is transmitted most frequently by persons having infection.\r\nDue to unavailability of any cure till date vaccination is the best way of protection and the only way to control the spread of disease.\r\nGenerally ,two basic patterns of polio infection are :\r\n\r\nMinor illness which does not involve the central nervous system (CNS), sometimes called abortive poliomyelitis,\r\nA major illness involving the CNS, which may be paralytic or nonparalytic\r\n\r\nPoliomyelitis generally spreads via the fecal-oral route by ingesting contaminated food or water and the oral-oral route. In endemic areas, polioviruses can affect the entire human population. The disease has a seasonal transmission in temperate climates, with a peak occurrence during summer and autumn."

This is known as abortive poliomyelitis, and is characterized by complete recovery in less than a week. Three symptoms observed with this form of poliovirus infection are upper respiratory tract infection (sore throat and fever) ,gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea) and influenza-like illness.\r\n1-2% of polio infections leads to Nonparalytic aseptic meningitis (symptoms of stiffness of the neck, back, and/or legs), usually following several days after the above mentioned symptoms similar to that of minor illness. Increased or abnormal sensations can also occur. Typically these symptoms will last from 2 to 10days, followed by complete recovery.\r\nFewer than 1% of all polio infections result in flaccid paralysis which is a clinical manifestation characterized by weakness or paralysis and reduced muscle tone . Paralytic symptoms generally begin 1 to 10 days after minor illness symptoms and progress for 2 to 3 days. Generally, no further paralysis occurs after the temperature returns to normal. Some signs and symptoms can include a loss of superficial reflexes, initially increased deep tendon reflexes and severe muscle aches and spasms in the limbs or back. The illness progresses to flaccid paralysis with diminished deep tendon reflexes, reaches a plateau without change for days to weeks, and is usually asymmetrical. Strength then begins to return. Patients do not experience sensory losses or changes in cognition.\r\nMany persons with paralytic poliomyelitis recover completely and in most cases muscle function returns to some degree. Weakness or paralysis still present 12 months after onset is usually permanent."

Those who had more severe polio and who recovered more function are more likely to be strongly affected by PPS.\r\nAlthough the cause of PPS is debated, the common theory is that it is the result of the slow weakening of nerve cells in the spinal cord that were damaged by the polio virus. Overworking these weakened neurons over time leads to even more damage, eventually giving rise to PPS. Symptoms of PPS can appear anywhere from 10 to 40 years after initial polio attack. The average time of onset is about 30 years after initial polio attack.\r\nPPS is not an infectious disease- it cannot spread from one person to another.

All patients with disc oedema should be investigated to rule out intracranial mass.\r\nAll patients with raised intracranial pressure do not develop papilloedema. Patients who had papilloedema before may not develop it again due to scarring of optic nerve head on subsequent rise in intracranial pressure. Conversely, patients of benign intracranial hypertension will not show papilloedema.\r\nVision is usually well preserved in cases of papilloedema. In contrast, optic disc swelling due to optic nerve diseases is associated with defect in vision.\r\nPapilloedema is due to axoplasmic flow stasis which results in disc oedema. Subarachnoid space of brain containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is continuous with that of optic nerve sheath. Therefore, rise in CSF pressure impedes axoplasmic transport which leads to papilloedema.\r\n\r\nhttp://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1217204-overview\r\nKanski, Jack J.

                "Diagnosis of pterygium is based on typical clinical appearance.\r\nA pterygium causes fibro-vascular change on the surface of conjunctiva and cornea. It is more common for the pterygium to be present on the nasal conjunctiva and then to extend onto the surface of cornea, although it can present temporally, as well as in other locations.\r\nClinically, pterygium can present in different fashion:\r\nSlow growing Pterygium:\r\nPterygium present as flat, slow growing lesion with minimal proliferation and a relatively atrophic appearance. Pterygium on surgical excision has a relatively lower incidence of recurrence.\r\nRapidly growing pterygium:\r\nPterygium present as significantly elevated fibro-vascular, rapidly growing lesion. It is progressive and fleshy with prominent vessels. Pterygium has a more aggressive clinical course and a higher incidence of recurrence following surgical excision.\r\nOther types:\r\n- Primary double pterygium: Primary double pterygium involves both nasal and temporal limbus.\r\n- Recurrent pterygium: Recurrent pterygium shows more scarring and is sometimes much wider.\r\n- Malignant pterygium: Malignant pterygium is a recurrent pterygium with symblepharon formation (adhesion of eyelid to the eyeball) and may be associated with restriction of ocular movement in opposite direction.\r\n\r\n    Recurrence sometimes may be associated with pyogenic granuloma formation.\r\n    Primary pterygium may undergo cystic changes with or without corneal dellen (thinning of cornea) and an eyelash may be present underneath the pterygium.\r\nClinical features:\r\nTypical findings of pterygium include:\r\n- Wing like triangular shaped fibro-vascular conjunctival growth within palpebral fissure with apex or head extending onto the cornea.\r\n- Vascular straightening in the direction of advancing head of pterygium on the corneal surface.\r\n- May be a thin translucent membrane or significantly thickened and elevated gelatinous tissue.\r\n- It may be present on nasal and/or temporal limbus of one or both eyes.\r\n- It may be white or pink lesion depending upon the vascularity.\r\n- Advanced cases may show involvement of visual axis.\r\n- A pigmented epithelial iron line called Stocker\u2019s line may be present in long standing and non progressive pterygium.\r\n- Pinguecula (yellowish triangular deposit on conjunctiva near limbus) may be present in ipsilateral or contra-lateral eye.\r\n- Restriction of ocular movement with diplopia (often seen in recurrent pterygium with conjunctival loss and scarring).\r\n\r\nMorphology of pterygium:\r\nVarious parts of pterygium are labelled as:-\r\n- Head: Head is the part which rests on cornea.\r\n- Neck: Neck is the constricted portion seen at the limbus.\r\n- Body: Body is the remaining bulk of mass.\r\n- Cap: Cap is a semi-lunar infiltrating portion in front of head of pterygium showing opaque spots (Fuch\u2019s spots). It is suggestive of progression.\r\n\r\nImaging studies:\r\n- Corneal topography: Corneal topography may be useful in assessing the degree of irregular astigmatism being produced by advanced pterygium.\r\n- External photography: External surface photography may be done for pterygium to follow its progression over the time.\r\nHistopathologic studies:\r\nPterygium is characterised by elastotic degeneration of collagen and fibro-vascular proliferation, with an overlying epithelial covering. Vermiform or elastotic degeneration refers to wavy worm-like appearance of the degenerated fibers. Epithelium is usually normal, but may be acanthotic, hyperkeratotic or even dysplastic and often exhibits goblet cell hyperplasia. Typically, there is destruction of Bowman\u2019s layer and superficial stroma by fibro-vascular in-growth.\r\nPterygium shows an accumulation of degenerated sub-epithelial tissue which stains basophilic with a characteristic slate grey appearance on Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining. This tissue also stains with elastic tissue stains, but it is not true elastic tissue, in that it is not digested by elastase.\r\nPterygium should be distinguished from:\r\n- Pseudo-pterygium: A pseudo-pterygium results from corneal inflammation due to chemical or thermal burns, trauma, marginal corneal disease, corneal ulcer or corneal perforation with reparative process leading to adhesion of a fold of conjunctiva to peripheral cornea.\r\nPseudo-pterygium is differentiated from true pterygium by history of inflammation in affected eye, location may be other than horizontal meridian, configuration not resembling wing structure, usually unilateral, non progressive and ability to pass probe (probe test) under the neck of pterygium.\r\n- Neoplasia: Neoplasia such as carcinoma in situ or squamous cell carcinoma should be excluded.\r\n- Pinguecula: Pinguecula is an actinic lesion confined to the peri-limbal conjunctiva that does not extend onto the cornea. Pinguecula are commonly occurring, usually small and asymptomatic, often yellow, raised nodules appearing on the bulbar conjunctiva. These are found commonly on the nasal side, but can also be present on temporal aspect of limbus. Pinguecula can occasionally undergo inflammation with symptoms of itching, burning or mild pain. Pinguecula show mild to moderate focal thickening of conjunctival stroma with elastotic degeneration of collagen.\r\n- Pannus formation.\r\n- Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration.\r\n- Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\r\n- Neurotrophic keratitis.\r\n- Symblepharon.\r\n- Limbal dermoid."

Patient should be observed for symptoms of significant redness, discomfort or changes in visual function.\r\nMedical therapy:\r\nMedical therapy includes:\r\n- Use of UV light blocking glasses: Patients who are at risk of developing pterygium because of a positive family history or because of extended period of exposure to UV light should use UV blocking glasses. Patient should avoid direct sunlight, wear goggles or may use cap to reduce ocular exposure.\r\n- Use of tear substitutes: Use of tear substitutes may be considered to minimise effect of environmental micro-trauma in those who are exposed to it. Lubricating drops and ointments may be used to alleviate symptoms of inflamed pterygium.\r\n- Vasoconstrictor drugs: Inflammation of pterygium may cause irritation, foreign body sensation and tearing and these symptoms may be relieved by use of vasoconstrictor eye drops.\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\nPterygium can be removed for cosmetic reasons, as well as for any functional abnormality of vision or any symptoms of ocular discomfort.\r\nIndications for surgical treatment of pterygium are:\r\n- Encroachment upon pupillary area and blocking visual axis, thereby causing diminution of vision.\r\n- Distortion of vision due to high astigmatism being induced by pterygium extending onto cornea.\r\n- Recurrent inflammation.\r\n- Evidence of progression like absence of Stocker\u2019s line.\r\n- Restriction of ocular movement with diplopia.\r\n- Cosmetic removal.\r\n- Rarely, for any suspected metaplastic change in pterygium.\r\nSurgical modalities are:\r\n- Pterygium excision with simple closure of wound.\r\n- Bare sclera technique of excision.\r\n- Transplantation of pterygium by suturing head of pterygium to its body or to the inferior fornix (junction between bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva).\r\n- Conjunctival autograft (CAG) with or without the use of Mitomycin C (Mitomycin C prevents recurrence). Due to increased occurrence of scleral complications, beta irradiation and thiotepa to reduce recurrence of pterygium, are seldom used today.\r\n- Amniotic membrane transplantation.\r\n- Use of fibrin glue with conjunctival or amniotic membrane transplantation.\r\n- Lamellar keratoplasty in conjunction with pterygium surgery.\r\n- Early laser treatment of recurrences may help in preventing progression."

There is no effective treatment for PCF.\r\nDepending upon the severity of signs and symptoms, patients are followed up for several days to weeks.\r\nGoals of pharmacotherapy (treatment with medicines) are to reduce morbidity and to prevent any complications.\r\nAntiviral eye drops were tried in some patients, but there was no definite benefit of these.\r\nSupportive medical management of PCF includes: \r\n- Cold compresses.\r\n- Artificial tears: Artificial tears stabilise and thicken pre-corneal tear film and prolong tear film break-up time (BUT), which occurs with dry eye.\r\n- Topical vasoconstrictor/antihistamine: Topical vasoconstrictor/antihistamine may be used for severe itching. On discontinuation, it may cause rebound (recurrence) of symptoms.\r\n- Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs): Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) may be used to reduce inflammation.\r\n- Topical antibiotic: Topical antibiotic may be used to prevent superadded bacterial infection.\r\n- Cycloplegic agents: Cycloplegic agents may be used for severe photophobia.\r\n- Mild topical corticosteroids: Mild topical corticosteroids may be used in severe membranous conjunctivitis or patients with marked reduction in vision due to late sub-epithelial opacities. While corticosteroids do assist in reducing inflammation, they do not have any significant impact on natural course of the disease. Taper this treatment slowly to avoid recurrence of corneal opacities. Any patient on topical corticosteroid should be observed for side effects such as elevated intraocular pressure and formation of cataract.\r\n- Topical immune-suppressants (e.g.Tacrolimus ointment): Topical immune-suppressants can inhibit autoimmune inflammatory responses. Tacrolimus is a treatment option for sub-epithelial infiltrates in PCF. Tacrolimus suppresses cellular immunity.\r\n- Ophthalmic antiseptics (e.g.Povidone-iodine): Ophthalmic antiseptics are broad-spectrum germicidal agents. Povidone-iodine has broad antibacterial and antiviral activity. Povidone iodine may be used to reduce the duration of disease.\r\nSurgical management:\r\nSurgery is extremely rare for PCF and is reserved for severe cases with cicatricial conjunctivitis or symblepharon.\r\nIf surgery is necessary, it is mainly in the form of:\r\n- Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK), along with low-dose mitomycin C (MMC), may be used to remove sub-epithelial opacities.\r\n- Membrane or pseudomembrane removal: Membrane or pseudomembrane may be peeled off gently and a topical corticosteroid may be prescribed.\r\n- Fornix reconstruction.\r\n- Entropion repair.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nMost cases of PCF are acute, benign and self-limiting. Infection usually resolves spontaneously within 2-3 weeks.\r\nSub-epithelial infiltrates may last for months together and may decrease vision if visual axis is involved."

The exact prevalence of PCOS is not known as the syndrome is not defined precisely. Prevalence of PCOS is highly variable ranging from 2.2% to 26% globally. In few Asian countries prevalence figures are ranging from 2% to 7.5% in China and 6.3% in Srilanka. There are few studies conducted in India. Studies done in South India and Maharashtra, prevalence of PCOS (by Rotterdam's criteria) were reported as 9.13% and 22.5% (10.7% by Androgen Excess Society criteria) respectively.\r\nPCOS was first reported by Stein and Leventhal in 1935, described as symptoms complex with amenorrhea, hirsutism, and enlarged ovaries with multiple cysts.\r\nPolycystic ovary syndrome causes irregular menstrual cycles, excessive body or facial hair and polycystic ovaries as its main symptoms. Polycystic means \"many cysts,\" and PCOS often causes clusters of small, pearl-sized cysts in the ovaries. The cysts are fluid-filled and contain immature eggs. Women with PCOS produce slightly higher amounts of male hormones known as androgens, which contribute to some of the symptoms of the condition.\r\nEarly diagnosis of PCOS is important as it has been linked to an increased risk for developing several medical conditions including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and heart disease. PCOS is an emerging health problem during adolescence therefore promotion of healthy lifestyles and early interventions are required to prevent future morbidities."

Androgens are male hormones that females also make. High levels of these hormones affect the development and release of eggs from ovary each month (process called ovulation).\r\nResearchers also thinkinsulinmay be linked to PCOS. Insulin is ahormonethat controls the change of sugar, starches, and other food into energy for the body to use or store.

                "Treatment of PCOS is not curative. Treatment focuses on controlling symptoms and managing the condition to prevent complications. The treatment will vary from woman to woman, depending on specific symptoms. Life style modifications consisting of a healthy diet and regular exercise are recommended for all women with PCOS, particularly those who are overweight.\r\nLifestyle modifications: Certain lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, are considered first-line treatment for adolescent girls and women with polycystic ovarian syndrome.These modifications have been effective in restoring ovulatory cycles and achieving pregnancy in obese women with PCOS. Weight loss in obese women with PCOS also improves androgen levels. Healthy eating tips include:\r\n\r\nLimiting processed foods and foods with added sugars, eating a diet low in cholesterol and saturated fats,\r\nAdding more whole-grain products, fruits, vegetables, and lean meats to diet.\r\n\r\nThis helps to lower blood glucose (sugar) levels, improve the body's use of insulin, and normalize hormone levels in the body. Even a 10 percent loss in body weight can restore a regular cycle.\r\nPharmacologic treatments: are used for metabolic derangements, such as anovulation, hirsutism, and menstrual irregularities:\r\n\r\nOral contraceptive agents/ Birth control pills/ are used to regularize menstrual cyclefor women who don't want to get pregnant.\r\n\r\nFertility medication- Lack of ovulation is usually the reason for fertility problems in women with PCOS. Several medications that stimulate ovulation can help women with PCOS to become pregnant.\r\n\r\nClomiphene therapy to stimulate ovulation.\r\nMetformin* along with clomiphene -The combination may help to use lower doses of medication to induce ovulation.\r\n\r\n            (*Metformin (Glucophage) is used to treat type 2 diabetes.

                "Perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC) is an inflammatory response of the conjunctiva triggered by exposure to allergens such as pollens, animal dander (flecks of dead skin cells and hair/feathers) and other environmental antigens. Intermittent (less than 4 weeks in duration) seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) and persistent (more than 4 weeks in duration) perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), makes up a large number of ocular (eye) allergy cases.\r\nPAC may not be caused exclusively by seasonal allergens, although they may play a role. PAC generally occurs in response to environmental allergens (dust mites, animal dander, moulds, cockroach dust, airborne allergens and cigarette smoke) that are present throughout the year and is generally chronic. About 79% of patients of PAC may still have seasonal exacerbations and is generally worse in the autumn when exposure to house dust mites, animal dander and fungal allergens is greatest. It is less common and tends to be milder than the seasonal form. Most cases of SAC occur during the spring and autumn when the level of seasonal allergens (i.e. pollens) is high. Majority of PAC and SAC affect both young and middle-aged people of both sexes.\r\nPAC and SAC are the common and sub-acute forms of ocular allergy, usually accompanied by seasonal allergic rhinitis. Although PAC and SAC are relatively mild conditions, rarely causing permanent visual impairment, their effects on the quality of life can be profound, with significant morbidity.\r\nAtopy (a genetic predisposition to develop an allergic reaction) is a genetically determined predisposition to hypersensitivity reaction upon exposure to specific environmental allergens/antigens. It includes allergic conjunctivitis, as well as seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma and eczema. Allergic conjunctivitis is a type I (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction, being mediated by de-granulation of mast cells (MCs) in response to the action of immunoglobulin E (IgE). \r\nPerennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC) represents a disease under chronic allergic conjunctivitis (CAC), together with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and, to a certain extent, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC). In perennial and seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival inflammation is quite mild and corneal involvement never occurs. In contrast, AKC and VKC are severe inflammatory diseases, which may involve cornea and can cause permanent visual impairment.\r\nPAC and SAC are more frequently associated with rhinitis, while AKC and VKC are more frequently associated with eczema and asthma respectively."

                "Perennial allergic conjunctivitis is less common than SAC and tends to be milder than the seasonal form.\r\nPAC causes symptoms throughout the year, generally worse in the autumn when exposure to animal dander, house dust mites and fungal allergens is highest. In contrast, Individuals with SAC have symptoms of acute allergic conjunctivitis for a defined period of time, caused by pollens from trees, weeds and grass, although the specific allergen varies in different geographic locations. Persons with SAC are symptom-free in winter/cooler climates because of the decreased airborne transmission of these allergens.\r\nAcute allergy is caused by IgE-mediated MC de-granulation, whereas chronic allergies are also associated with continuous activation of MC but with predominance of mediators, such as eosinophils and T- helper2 (Th2) lymphocyte-generated cytokines.\r\nPathophysiology:\r\nBoth PAC and SAC are type I (immediate) IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, due to environmental airborne allergens, with the mast cell (MC) playing a central role. A reaction occurs when a sensitised individual is exposed to a particular antigen. IgE has strong affinity for MCs triggering its de-granulation.\r\nAn allergen reacts with specific IgE antibodies bound to a sensitised MC, triggering cross-linkage of the IgE molecules and an influx of calcium ions into the MC. This causes the MC to de-granulate and release preformed inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, which causes the signs and symptoms associated with the early-phase response in sensitised individuals.\r\nThere are two components of MC activation. The first is the release of pre-formed mediators, including histamine. The second is the synthesis of arachidonic acid and the subsequent metabolic cascade, resulting in production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.\r\nHistamine binds to Histamine1(H1) receptors and results in primary allergic symptoms of itching, burning, tearing and stinging sensation, while binding to the Histamine2(H2) receptor releases leukotrienes and prostaglandins, stimulating mucus production and also increasing vascular permeability. This early phase response is immediate and lasts clinically for about 20-30 minutes. (http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/histamine/jm/receptors.htm).\r\nMC de-granulation also initiates a series of cellular and extracellular events, which lead to the late-phase response (production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes). MCs also release cytokines and chemotactic factors which induce the production of IgE from B lymphocytes (B cells), enhance the production of T helper lymphocytes, attract eosinophils and activate vascular endothelial corneal and conjunctival cells to release chemokines and adhesion molecules. Chemokines and adhesion molecules mediate the infiltration of eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils and T helper lymphocytes to the site of inflammation.\r\nDe-granulating eosinophils release toxic proteins which have cytotoxic effects and further enhance MC de-granulation. These products of eosinophils are toxic to the corneal epithelium and, if present chronically, may result in ulceration. The late phase response is characterised by an influx of multiple inflammatory cells."

                "Diagnosis of PAC is generally based on clinical history and careful slit-lamp (bio-microscopic) examination by an eye-specialist.\r\nImportant features of the history include a personal or family history of atopic disease such as:\r\n- Allergic rhinitis.\r\n- Bronchial asthma.\r\n- Atopic dermatitis.\r\nPatients with PAC are more likely to also have perennial rhinitis with features of sneezing and nasal discharge.\r\n\r\nSigns and symptoms of PAC (are usually milder and with longer duration) and SAC are essentially similar and typically develop on a gradual basis but can also develop suddenly following contact with the offending allergen. The difference relies on specific allergens to which patients are sensitive and the chronicity of exposure.\r\nPAC remains self-limited without ocular surface damage and is usually bilateral, although it may be asymmetrical. If the allergic insult occurs with a particular allergen entering only one eye, ocular changes may exceptionally be unilateral. The symptoms and signs are recurrent, occurring rapidly following the exposure to allergens.\r\nPAC is less common than SAC and, as patients are chronically exposed to allergen, symptoms and signs occur year-round. The most common triggers are mould spores, animal dander, and dust mites usually found in the household. Patients may also be sensitive to seasonal allergen with a superimposed offender to their symptoms. Because of the prolonged exposure, the conjunctiva may become boggy, chronically red, and irritated. Papillary hypertrophy along the tarsal conjunctival surface may occur with chronic exposure to allergens in PAC. The discharge is whitish but thick, and even stringy.\r\nMoulds, house dust, and animal dander participate in the disease process. The severity of symptoms varies depending on the type of allergen, its concentration, and time of exposure.\r\nDry eye facilitates allergen contact with the ocular surface since the capability of tears to \u2018wash away\u2019 the allergen is usually compromised.\r\nThe most significant symptom in allergic conjunctivitis is itching. Patients usually complain of intense itching of the eyes, sometimes along with a burning sensation and tearing. Discharge is usually serous, clear and watery, but with a ropy characteristic.\r\nWithout itching, the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis is suspect. With intense itching, the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis is very likely, but one should also consider ocular conditions like dry eye, toxic conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis, blepharitis, and other forms of allergic conjunctivitis. In these other disorders, itching is usually mild and occasional.\r\nSigns of SAC: \r\nSigns on slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) examination may be:\r\n- Lid oedema.\r\n- Mucoid discharge, which may be stringy/ropy.\r\n- Mild papillary reaction.\r\n- Conjunctival hyperaemia.\r\n- Chemosis may be apparent in the bulbar and lower tarsal conjunctiva, giving to it a \u2018milky\u2019 or pale pink appearance.\r\n- Dramatic unilateral bulging of the conjunctiva, frequently described as the acute formation of a \u2018bubble\u2019 in the eye, mainly when patients rub their eyes. Conjunctiva balloons, due to intense and acute infiltration of cells and fluids, causing chemosis.\r\n- Dellen (shallow saucer-shaped excavations in periphery of cornea) of cornea may form due to intense conjunctival chemosis and unstable tear film. Dellen may resolve with the resolution of chemosis.\r\n- Punctate keratitis may be present rarely.\r\nDiagnostic procedures:\r\nInvestigations are generally not required.\r\n- Intra-dermal skin test: Intra-dermal skin test is the standard clinical test for the diagnosis of type I hypersensitivity reaction. Cutaneous tests, such as the scratch or prick, and more rarely, the intra-cutaneous injections, may be utilised to determine the antigens causing hypersensitivity. The prick test is the preferred method because it is more sensitive, less variable, and more comfortable to patients than the intra-cutaneous test.\r\nNormally, skin test for particular allergens is rarely needed.\r\n- Superficial conjunctival scrapings: Superficial conjunctival scrapings in more active cases may help to establish the diagnosis by revealing characteristic eosinophils which are not normally present on the conjunctiva. However, eosinophils are observed in the most severe cases, but are generally present in the deep layers of the substantia propria of the conjunctiva. For this reason, the absence of eosinophils on conjunctival scrapings does not rule out the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis. Even the presence of one eosinophil or eosinophilic granules is consistent with a diagnosis of allergy.\r\n- Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST): Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST), a blood test, may also help to define the allergens. Elevated IgE levels in serum (RAST, ELISA) and in tear fluid are present in almost all patients with PAC.\r\n- Conjunctival provocation test: Conjunctival provocation test consist of instilling offending allergen into the conjunctival sac, producing the typical symptoms of PAC. Conjunctival provocation tests are rarely necessary for the diagnosis of PAC and it has rather proven to be a reliable method to evaluate ocular therapeutics.\r\n- Nasal allergy test: There is also a possible involvement of nasal allergy in some patients with allergic conjunctivitis, such as PAC, and therefore, there may be value to a nasal challenge with allergen combined with registration of ocular features.\r\nPAC should be differentiated from conditions like:\r\n- Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome).\r\n- Contact dermatitis.\r\n- Toxic conjunctivitis.\r\n- Blepharitis.\r\n- Other forms of allergic conjunctivitis.\r\n- Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis.\r\n- Bacterial conjunctivitis.\r\n- Viral conjunctivitis."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nGeneral measures:\r\nManagement of PAC includes reducing the amount of allergen exposure.\r\n- Keeping household clean: Allergens in PAC are usually mould spores, animal dander, dust mites, and are predominantly found in the household. Therefore, carpets must be cleaned, changed or removed, as well as children\u2019s stuffed animals, soft toys, and curtains. The mattress top and sides must also be cleaned and enclosed in plastic bags or other dust mite proof cover. Sheets, pillows and blankets should be washed in hot water (54 degree Celsius). Pillows and the base of the bed must be vacuumed regularly. Pets should be kept out of the bedroom, and the bathroom should be kept clean and dry to inhibit mould growth.\r\n- Air purifiers: While it is better to stop dust mites at the source, reducing the dust levels in the air could be an adequate strategy. Air purifiers that use high-efficiency particulate arrestance or high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration are more effective and safer (remove up to 99% of the material like dust mite faeces, all allergens, such as animal dander, dust, pollen, or cockroach faeces).\r\nSupportive measures:\r\nSupportive measures include:\r\n- Cold compresses: Cold compresses decrease ocular inflammation.\r\n- Saline solutions: Irrigation of ocular surface with saline solution facilitates removal of allergens, and thus achieves the primary principle of allergy management by minimising exposure of the ocular surface to allergens.\r\n- Artificial tears: Preservative-free artificial tears may be used to wash or dilute allergens and inflammatory mediators away from the ocular surface. In addition, some types of artificial tears provide relief through the lubrication of the ocular surface. Ointments or time-released tear replacements, used at night, provide a longer-lasting measure, delivering ocular surface lubrication during sleep. These agents are used for mild PAC only since they neither treat the underlying allergic response nor modify the activity of any of the mediators of inflammation. Artificial tear solutions should be kept in refrigerator, since the use of cold drops produces vasoconstriction, ameliorating symptoms and signs.\r\n- Avoidance of eye rubbing. \r\nMedical therapy:\r\nIt is important to note that in the treatment of acute or chronic forms of allergic eye diseases, patient compliance may not be ideal, giving the false impression of poor efficacy of medical therapy.\r\nMedical therapy includes:\r\n- Topical vasoconstrictors: Topical vasoconstrictors may provide short-term relief. Decongestant reduces chemosis, eyelid oedema, and redness by inducing vasoconstriction. There is also some amelioration of ocular itching with the use of topical vasoconstrictors. Like artificial tears, topical vasoconstrictors do not reduce the allergic response, because they do not antagonise any of the mediators of allergic inflammation. However, prolonged use of vasoconstrictors may cause rebound conjunctival redness and inflammation (\u2018conjunctivitis medicamentosa\u2019) (Spector S &amp; Raizman M (1994): Conjunctivitis medicamentosa. J Allergy Clin Immunol 94: 134\u2013136.), and they are ineffective in severe ocular allergy. To minimise this potential side-effect, exposure to medicine should be limited through less frequent dosing or shorter treatment durations. Examples include naphazoline, and oxymetazoline.\r\n- Topical antihistamine: Antihistamine eye drops are prescribed for the relief of acute signs and symptoms of PAC by blocking the histamine receptors in the conjunctiva. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus. For allergic complaints limited to eyes, topical anti-histamines are prescribed and are free of untoward side-effects of systemic oral anti-histamines. Topical anti-histamines provide faster relief than systemic anti-histamines and have longer duration of action than topical vasoconstrictors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pure mast cell stabilisers and corticosteroids, the drugs commonly used in the treatment of ocular allergy. These medications do not affect other pro-inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which remain uninhibited. Examples include pyrilamine and pheniramine.\r\n- Combined topical vasoconstrictor and antihistamine: Combined topical vasoconstrictor and antihistamine like antazoline (antihistamine) with xylometazoline (vasoconstrictor), may provide short term relief. Decongestant reduces chemosis, eyelid oedema, and redness by inducing vasoconstriction. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus.\r\n- Systemic antihistamines: Systemic antihistamines may also relieve signs and symptoms of allergy. Oral antihistamines may be indicated for severe symptoms of allergy involving eyes, pharynx and nose simultaneously. Some, such as diphenhydramine, cause significant drowsiness and may be useful in aiding sleep.\r\n- Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms of PAC. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. The enhanced clinical efficacy of these medicines over first-generation anti-histamines like pheniramine may be due to inhibitory effects of new-generation anti-histamines on the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines are much more selective for peripheral H1 receptors, as opposed to the central nervous system H1 receptors, cholinergic receptors, and some H2 receptors that cause cardiac arrhythmia. This selectivity significantly reduces the occurrence of adverse drug reactions, such as drowsiness/ sedative action, dry eye and dry mouth.\r\n- Topical mast cell stabilisers: Topical mast cell stabilisers decrease the de-granulation of conjunctival MCs, preventing the release of histamine and other chemotactic factors. However, the drug does not relieve existing symptoms and has no role in the treatment of the acute phase of PAC; mast cell stabilisers should be used on a prophylactic basis. They need to be used long term (treatment effect usually requires continued use over 5-7 days) or in conjunction with other classes of medications, such as antihistamines. Examples are cromolyn sodium, Iodoxamide, nedocromil, and pemirolast.\r\n- H1 receptor blocker and mast-cell stabiliser (Dual-acting agents): Dual-acting agents exert multiple pharmacological effects, such as histamine receptor antagonist action, stabilisation of MC de-granulation and, subsequently, suppression of activation and infiltration of eosinophils. Examples are oloptadine, azelastine, epinastine and ketotifen. Drugs also exert anti-inflammatory effects through other mechanisms e.g. olopatadine affects release of cytokines.\r\n- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit production of prostaglandins and have no role in blocking mediator such as leukotrienes. Example is ketorolac tromethamine and diclofenac.\r\n- Topical corticosteroids: Corticosteroid eye drops are very effective in treating PAC, but the numerous adverse effects, such as secondary infections, elevated intraocular pressure, and formation of cataract, make their use selective. Patients using corticosteroids should be closely monitored. Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids are broad and non-specific. Topical steroids must be prescribed only for a short period of time and for severe cases that do not respond to other therapy. Pulse dosing of topical steroids may be employed, followed by maintenance with an MC stabiliser. Modified steroids such as loteprednol etabonate and rimexolone may be used, and loteprednol has superior safety profile.\r\n- Immune-modulators: Immune-modulators such as cyclosporine drops and tacrolimus ointment have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of ocular allergy. Cyclosporine A is an immunosuppressant that acts by inhibiting eosinophilic infiltration by interfering with type IV allergic reactions in the conjunctiva. Tacrolimus acts mainly by inhibiting the action of T cells. Both agents are associated with fewer side effects and are preferred over chronic use of corticosteroids in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Immune-modulator agents are reserved for more severe forms of allergic conjunctivitis (such as VKC and AKC) and have limited indications in cases of PAC.\r\n- Allergen-specific immunotherapy: Allergen-specific immunotherapy is an effective treatment used to induce immunologic tolerance when the allergen is well known. The primary objectives of allergen-specific immunotherapy are to decrease the symptoms triggered by allergens and to prevent recurrence of the disease in the long term. It is indicated in patients who have evidence of specific IgE antibodies to clinically relevant allergens. Skin prick testing is the preferred method of testing for specific IgE antibodies and identification of allergen for the immunotherapy. Candidates for immunotherapy include those who:\r\n(1) Have symptoms that are not well controlled by pharmacological therapy or avoidance measures.\r\n(2) Require high doses of medication, multiple medications, or both to maintain control of their disease.\r\n(3) Experience adverse effects of medications, or\r\n(4) Wish to avoid the long-term use of pharmacological therapy.\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nPrognosis of PAC is good despite significant discomfort and undesirable cosmetic appearance. Allergic conjunctivitis generally clears up readily. Although, allergic conjunctivitis may commonly reoccur, it rarely causes complications or visual loss."

PKC is characterised by sub-epithelial, single or multiple, gray-white, raised conjunctival or corneal nodules, generally at or near the limbus, surrounded by a zone of engorged hyperaemic vessels.\r\nThe description of phlyctenulosis dates back to early Greek and Arabic writings. (Thygeson P. The etiology and treatment of phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis. Am J Ophthalmol. 1951; 34:1217-36). The term phlyctenule comes from the Greek word \u2018phlyctena\u2019 which means blister. Sorsby and Thygeson have implicated a higher incidence of PKC amongst children and young adult (Sorsby A. The etiology of phlyctenular ophthalmia. Br J Ophthalmol. 1942; 26: 159-79).\r\nThe most common cause of PKC is a hypersensitivity reaction to tuberculoprotein, particularly in the developing world, where Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) remains endemic. However, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), Chlamydia, parasitic infection, fungal infection, and more recently, HLA subtypes A26, B35, and DR8 have also been demonstrated as causative agents. Other risk factors include those common to communicable disease such as malnutrition, overcrowding, poor hygiene, and sanitation. There is slight overall predilection towards female gender, although this varies depending on the primary aetiology of PKC. PKC is not a blinding disease but it is a source of lowered visual acuity."

                "Phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis is an endogenous non-infectious inflammatory type IV delayed hypersensitivity (T cell-mediated) allergic reaction to an antigen. The disease is common in malnourished and debilitated children between five and twelve years of age. These children may suffer from enlarged tonsils, adenoids and cervical lymphadenopathy.\r\nVarious aetiological factors which contribute to development of PKC are:\r\nBacteria:\r\n\r\nMycobacterium tuberculosis.\r\nStaphylococcus aureus.\r\nPropionibacterium acnes.\r\nChlamydia trachomatis.\r\n\r\nParasites:\r\n\r\nAscaris lumbricoides.\r\nAncylostoma dudenale.\r\nHymenolepis nana.\r\nEntamoeba histolytica.\r\n\r\nFungi:\r\n\r\nCandida albicans.\r\nCoccidioides immitis.\r\n\r\nHuman leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtypes:\r\n\r\nA26.\r\nB35.\r\nDR8.\r\n\r\nMeibomitis:\r\nPhlectenular keratitis may be associated with meibomitis ( Suzuki T, Mitsushi Y, Yoichiro S, et al. Phlectenular keratitis associated with meibomitis in young patients. Am J Ophthalmol. 2005; 140: 77-82).\r\n\r\nMycobacterium tuberculosis:\r\nM. tuberculosis is the most common cause of PKC worldwide, more so in the developing world, where tuberculosis remains endemic. PKC can occur in:\r\n\r\nPatients with active or inactive tuberculosis.\r\nHistory of positive Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) test or X-ray chest.\r\nFamily history of tuberculosis.\r\nPreclinical patients who will subsequently develop tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nTuberculosis related phlyctenulosis is more symptomatic and recurrent than phlyctenulosis caused by other pathogens. It frequently occurs as multiple lesions, and presents bilaterally in just over half of the cases, but may occur unilaterally as well. M. Tuberculosis is not being isolated from culture of ocular tissue. However, the diagnosis is made through systemic screening.\r\nStaphylococcus aureus:\r\nS. aureus is a more common cause of PKC in developed countries. Patients presenting with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) or chronic staphylococcal blepharoconjunctivitis are particularly susceptible. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical presentation which may be substantiated with bacterial culture. It is less common and mild as compared to tuberculosis related PKC.\r\nPropionibacterium acnes:\r\nP.acnes is also linked to ocular surface inflammation (Suzuki T, Sano Y, Sasaki O, et al. Ocular surface inflammation induced by Propionibacterium acnes. Cornea.2002; 21: 812-7). Diagnosis depends upon the clinical presentation and bacterial culture.\r\nHelminth infections:\r\nHelminth is more common than other parasitic infections. Helminths primarily affect limbus and cornea and spare conjunctiva. Delayed hypersensitivity reaction is produced due to eosinophilic response. With antihelminthic therapy, resolution of disease is faster than other infectious causes.\r\nGenetic association:\r\nSuzuki et al envisaged a genetic association of PKC. These include Human leukocyte antigen subtype (HLA) A26, B35, DR8. It is proposed that Human leukocyte antigen subtype (HLA) A26, B35 and DR8 play a specific role in the corneal helper T lymphocyte type I reaction that may produce phlyctenule lesions.\r\nMeibomitis:\r\nSuzuki et al. showed a preponderance of phlyctenulosis related to meibomitis in female patients (Suzuki T, Mitsushi Y, Yoichiro S, et al. Phlectenular keratitis associated with meibomitis in young patients. Am J Ophthalmol. 2005; 140: 77-82).They suggested a link between the expressions of sex steroid hormone receptors on the ocular surface, which predisposes females to PKC secondary to meibomitis."

                "Clinical signs may vary slightly according to the specific causative organism. It may occur either unilaterally or bilaterally in the conjunctiva, cornea or at limbus. The presence of phlycten on the palpebral conjunctiva is a rarity. Phlyctenulosis may also be an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients with a recent history of bacterial, parasitic, or fungal infection.\r\nPhlyctenulosis begins as phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis or phlyctenular conjunctivitis. Phlyctenulosis rarely starts as keratitis only. Phlyctenular conjunctivitis is more common on bulbar than over palpebral conjunctiva, in association with hyperaemia and little discharge. Symptoms are often mild and many patients may have asymptomatic phlyctenulosis. Disease limited to the conjunctiva is self-limiting and usually resolves within two weeks.\r\nPKC presents as a small, round, elevated, grey or yellow, localised sub-epithelial infiltrate in the conjunctiva, limbus, or cornea, located adjacent to an area of hyperaemic blood vessels. Limbus is the most commonly affected site in PKC. In about two to three weeks time, these infiltrates ulcerate, leaving behind wedge-shaped fibro-vascular scars at limbus or in cornea. Phlyctenules of the conjunctiva do not form scars.\r\nDiagnosis requires examination under slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) by an eye-specialist.\r\nClinical signs of PKC:\r\n\r\nBlepharitis.\r\nMeibomitis.\r\nInflammation of conjunctiva or cornea.\r\nConjunctival or scleral injection.\r\nSub-epithelial conjunctival or corneal nodules surrounded by engorged hyperaemic blood vessels.\r\nPunctate epithelial keratopathy.\r\nPannus.\r\nNecrosis and ulceration of infiltrates.\r\nWedge-shaped fibro-vascular scar.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhlyctenulosis may show patterns such as:\r\n\r\n\u2018Wandering phlyctenule\u2019: \u2018Wandering phlyctenule\u2019 is the most characteristic presentation of PKC. Limbal phlyctenule spreads across the cornea paracentrally and perpendicular to the limbus, leaving behind a superficial and vascular scar in its place.\r\nMarginal ulcers: Marginal ulcers may occur in which phlyctenulosis starts at the limbus and progresses to the cornea without leaving behind a clear space between the limbus and ulcer.\r\nDiffuse central pattern: A diffuse central pattern without ulceration often occurs in recurrent disease. This may lead to an in-growth of superficial or deep vessels.\r\nPannus: There may be pannus formation in PKC. Pannus of PKC is distinguished from trachomatous pannus by the presence of diffuse central infiltrates and vessels which run straight from the limbus to the cornea.\r\nMiliary disease: In miliary disease, small phlyctenules cover the surface of the cornea. It is rarely seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistological studies:\r\nPhlyctenules are sub-epithelial inflammatory infiltrates that contain cells such as histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils. The basal epithelium overlying these nodular infiltrates is composed of mononuclear phagocytes, neutrophils and Langerhans cells.\r\nThe inflammation in phlyctenular infiltrates is a delayed hypersensitivity response that predominantly has monocyte derived cells. Phlycten shows a characteristic sub-epithelial mononuclear infiltration in a triangular area, the apex being directed towards deeper layers of cornea. There is cuffing around stromal blood vessels with sub-epithelial mononuclear, polymorphonuclear leukocytes and eosinophils. Perivascular infiltrate transforms into macrophages and finally into dendritic cells that react with monoclonal antibodies. Helper and inducer T-lymphocytes become sensitised, leading to the generation of activated T-cells and finally the release of lymphokines. Lymphokines cause an influx of inflammatory cells. Lymphocytes are less abundant than mononuclear cells in phlyctenular infiltrates.\r\nWhen secondary infection supervenes, additional polymorphonuclear cells appear and the overlying epithelium undergoes necrosis.\r\nPhlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis should be distinguished from conditions such as:\r\n\r\nTrachoma.\r\nStaphylococcal marginal keratitis.\r\nMicrobial keratitis.\r\nNodular episcleritis.\r\nInflamed pinguecula.\r\nInflammed pseudo-pterygium.\r\nForeign body granuloma.\r\nFiltering bleb following glaucoma surgery.\r\nSuture cyst.\r\nDermoid cyst.\r\nOcular rosacea."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision only.\r\nThe treatment of PKC is directed to improve general health of the child and management of local condition. Infected tonsils and adenoids should be properly treated. Attempts should be made to desensitise the patient against tubercular or staphylococcal allergens. Concurrent infections should be treated with systemic antibiotic therapy. Recurrences are frequent if general condition is not treated properly.\r\nManagement of phlyctenulosis consists of antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory measures. Even asymptomatic patients should be treated because of high rate of recurrence.\r\nGeneral measures:\r\n\r\nEyelid hygiene: Any underlying blepharitis should be addressed to with proper hygiene. Eyelid margins should be properly cleaned with sterile cotton tipped applicator, soaked in baby \u2018no tears\u2019 shampoo.\r\nArtificial tears: Artificial tears or lubricating ointments may be used for symptomatic relief.\r\nDiet: A calorie-rich diet supplemented with vitamins A, C and D and calcium may be given.\r\nTinted glasses: Tinted glasses give protection against associated glare and photophobia.\r\nWarm compresses and irrigation: Warm compresses and irrigation with saline reduces mucopurulent discharge in cases with superadded secondary infections.\r\n\r\nMedical therapy: \r\nTopical antibiotic agents are indicated for use in conjunction with anti-inflammatory medications such as corticosteroids or cyclosporine regardless of aetiology.\r\nAntibiotic therapy:\r\nAntibiotics like oral tetracycline or erythromycin are effective in treating cases of S. aureus and P. acnes related disease. It has also been successfully used to treat patients with recurrent disease that has failed other therapeutic measures. Care should be taken when treating paediatric patients younger than eight years of age to avoid potential side-effects. Other antibiotics which may be used are gatifloxacin, bacitracin, and azithromycin.\r\nAnti-tubercular therapy:\r\nIn tuberculosis associated PKC, patients should be screened for underlying active infection, and are treated with the appropriate anti-tubercular medical therapy. Family members or close contacts should also be screened and treated.\r\nAnti-parasite medicines: \r\nPatients with helminthic infections should be treated with parasite-specific oral medication like mebendazole. PKC in these patients typically resolves quickly with therapy, with a low recurrence rate. Recurrence may be due to re-infection with the parasites.\r\nAnti-fungal medicines: Anti-fungal medicines are used for a fungal infection and these diseases generally follow a successful course after treatment.\r\nTopical corticosteroids:\r\nTopical corticosteroids are used as anti-inflammatory therapy and is usually started early in the course of management. Corticosteroids should be tapered gradually since rapid tapers are associated with recurrence of the disease. Topical corticosteroids may be associated with ocular complications like raised intraocular pressure, cataract formation, and disturbance of accommodation.\r\nTopical cyclosporine A:\r\nTopical cyclosporine A, an immune-modulator, may be used to control signs of inflammation.\r\nCycloplegic agent may be required when cornea is involved.\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nPhlyctenular conjunctivitis often has mild symptoms and many patients may be asymptomatic. Disease limited to the conjunctiva is self-limiting and usually resolves within two weeks without leaving any scar. However, recurrences are common.\r\nPhlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis commonly affects limbus with nodular infiltrates. In about two to three weeks time, these infiltrates ulcerate, leaving behind wedge-shaped fibro-vascular scars at limbus or in cornea."

                "Plague is a communicable disease, caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis. It is one of the oldest diseases known to man and still occurs in the tropics, subtropics and warmer areas of temperate countries. Past outbreaks have shown that plague may reoccur in areas that have long remained silent.\r\nPlague is primarily a zoonotic disease (transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans)\r\nof wild rodents and man is affected incidentally. It is transmitted from one rodent to another by fleas (ectoparasites) and from animals to humans either by the bite of infected fleas, or direct contact, inhalation and rarely, ingestion of infective materials when handling infected hosts.\r\nWidespread pandemics (disease occurring over a wide geographic area and affecting an exceptionally high proportion of the population) of plague have occurred in past with high mortality. It was known as the \"Black Death\" during the fourteenth century, causing an estimated 50 million deaths. Nearly half of deaths were in Asia and Africa and the other half were in Europe.\r\nPlague is endemic (a disease that occurs regularly in a particular area) in many countries in Africa, former Soviet Union, Americas and Asia. The distribution of plague coincides with the geographical distribution of the rodents it infects, which are found in all continents except Australia.\r\nPlague epidemics (unusually high occurrence of a disease in a population or area) have occurred in Africa, Asia, and South America but since the 1990s, most human cases have occurred in Africa. In 2013 there were 783 cases reported worldwide, including 126 deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO), 20 countries in Africa, America, and Asia are identified as natural foci for plague. The 3 most endemic countries are Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru. In Madagascar, outbreaks have occurred nearly every year since 1980.\r\nIn India, outbreaks of plague occurred in Mamla village of district Beed, Maharashtra state (bubonic type) and district Surat in Gujarat state (pneumonic type) in September 1994. Subsequently, suspected cases of pneumonic plague were reported from Delhi, Varanasi, Karnataka and other states. A total of 876 cases and 54 deaths were reported. In 2002, outbreak of pneumonic plague occurred in Himachal Pradesh with 16 cases and 4 deaths. In 2004, outbreak of bubonic plague was reported from Dangud village, of district Uttar Kashi, Uttarakhand state with 8 cases &amp; 3 deaths. \r\nThe National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi has identified four sylvatic foci (affecting wild animals) in India; the tri-junction of south India (Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu), Beed belt in Maharashtra, Rohru in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. NCDC is keeping routine surveillance in these areas.\r\nWeak health systems and low standards of environmental hygiene are risk factors for outbreaks of human plague. As with many primarily zoonotic diseases, plague is a very severe disease in people, with case fatality rates of 50-60% if left untreated."

Disease starts with flu like symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body-aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea.\r\nDepending on the route of infection, there are three forms of plague: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic.\r\n\r\nBubonicplague is the most common form of plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea usually on the lower extremities. Plague bacillus(Y. pestis), enters at the bite site and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node where it proliferates. The lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful, swollen and is called a \"bubo\". The most usual place for this swelling is the groin, but it also occurs in the armpits and the neck. At advanced stages of the infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into suppurating open sores. Bubonic plague cannot spread from person to person.\r\n\r\nSepticaemicplague occurs when infection spreads directly through the bloodstream without forming a \u201cbubo\". Septicaemic plague may result from flea bites and from direct contact with infective materials through cracks in the skin. Advanced stages of the bubonic form of plague will also lead to direct spread of Y. pestisin the blood.\r\n\r\nPneumonicplague-or lung-based plague- It is less common form of plague and is caused by spread of infection to the lungs from advanced bubonic plague. It is highly infectious and can spread from human to human via infected air droplets or through infected clothing and other contaminated articles. Untreated pneumonic plague has a very high case-fatality ratio."

Y. pestis is easily destroyed by sunlight, high temperatures, and disinfectants. \r\nVectors of plague- Fleas are the natural vectors of plague in the world. In India, the important fleas for plague transmission are Xenopsylla cheopis, X. astia and X. brasiliensis. Out of these X. cheopis is the principal vector.\r\nReservoir of infection \u2013 Wild rodents are the natural hosts of Y. pestis. At least 220 species of rodents which inhabit mountains, plains, deserts, cultivated fields and forests in both temperate and tropical climate are known to be infected with plague bacillus. Tatera indica among the wild rodents and Rattus norvegicus and R.rattus among the commensal rodents play an important role as reservoir of Y. pestis. In India Tatera indica acts as a main reservoir of infection, not the domestic rat (R.rattus).Generally the infection is maintained by the resistant species of the wild rodents. The susceptible rodents die due to the disease. \r\nMode of transmission-\r\nFlea bites-Plague bacteria are mostly transmitted by bite of an infected flea. During plague epizootics (occurrence of disease at higher rates than expected, in animal population), many rodents die, and causing hungry fleas to seek other sources of blood. People and animals that visit places where rodents have recently died from plague are at risk of being infected from flea bites. Dogs and cats may also bring plague-infected fleas into the home. Flea bite exposure may result in primarybubonic or septicaemic plague.\r\nContact with contaminated fluid or tissue- Humans can become infected when handling tissue or body fluids of a plague-infected animal without using proper precautions such as hunters. This type of transmission results in bubonic plague or septicaemic plague.\r\nInfectious droplets- Infected droplets from a case of pneumonic plaque can infect other person. Contact with infected cats can transmit the infection to humans by droplet infection."

Pinguecula are less transparent than normal conjunctiva and often have a fatty appearance. They are usually bilateral, triangular, elevated, white to yellow in colour, horizontally oriented, and are located nasally much more often than temporally. They may also present on both the nasal and temporal conjunctiva in the eyes of some patients. Pinguecula does not cross the limbus, and current information suggests that pinguecula does not progress to pterygium and that the two are distinct disorders.\r\nPinguecula are associated with a two to three fold increase in incidence of age-related macular degeneration, possibly through a common light exposure effect (Pham TQ et al).\r\nDegenerations of the conjunctiva are common conditions that, in most cases, have relatively little effect on ocular function and vision. These conditions increase in prevalence with increasing age as a result of past inflammation, of long-term toxic effects of environmental exposure, or of ageing itself. Conjunctival degenerations may be associated with chronic irritation, dryness, or previous history of trauma."

Pinguecula are more common than pterygium.\r\nEvidence suggests its association with:\r\n\r\nIncreasing age: Pinguecula are seen in most of the patients by 70- 80 years of age.\r\nUltraviolet light exposure: Chronic sunlight exposure (actinic damage due to both ultraviolet A and B light) is associated with outdoor work and equatorial residence. Association with light exposure is found in welders, who have higher rate of pinguecula as compared to non-welders. Possibly, predominantly nasal location is related to reflection of light from the nose onto the nasal conjunctiva. The effect of ultraviolet light may be mediated by mutations in gene p53.\r\nGaucher\u2019s disease (inherited lipid storage disease): Pigmented, brown, triangular pinguecula may appear during second decade of Gaucher\u2019s disease. Biopsy from the lesions shows Gaucher cells. Patients with Gaucher\u2019s disease may show associated congenital oculomotor apraxia and white retinal infiltrates. There may be corneal opacities in posterior two-thirds of the stroma. The genetic defect in Gaucher\u2019s disease lies on chromosome 1q21."

                "The diagnosis is usually clinical and may require slit-lamp biomicroscopy.\r\nClinical features:\r\n\r\nPinguecula are located in the anterior bulbar conjunctiva adjacent to the limbus.\r\nPinguecula are located in the inter-palpebral zone, usually more nasally than temporally.\r\nUsually, there is no corneal involvement. However, there may be punctate epithelial erosions or dellen (thinning of adjacent peripheral part of cornea due to drying).\r\nA grading system showed no significant difference in nasal versus temporal size.\r\nPinguecula are yellowish-white sub-epithelial deposits with possible calcifications.\r\nOccasionally pinguecula may become inflamed (called pingueculitis) and irritated due to surface drying. The lesion may become highly vascularised and injected.\r\n\r\nHistopathology:\r\nPinguecula are characterised by elstotic degeneration of the collagen with hyalinisation of the conjunctival stroma, collection of basophilic elastotic fibers, and granular deposits.\r\n\r\nThe sub-epithelial tissue shows senile elastosis (basophilic degeneration) and irregular, dense sub-epithelial concretions. The elastotic material stains positively for elastin but is not sensitive to elastase (elastotic degeneration).\r\nThe elastotic material is positive for elastin, microfibrillar protein, and amyloid P. These components never normally co-localise.\r\n\r\nThe control of elastogenesis is seriously defective so that elastic fibers are abnormal in biochemical organisation. Normal assembly of elastic fibers is prevented due to marked reduction of elastic microfibrils. Limbal epithelial cell mutations at gene p53, probably due to ultraviolet irradiation, may be an early event in the development of pinguecula. The sub-epithelial dense concretions stain positively for lysozyme. Pinguecula may calcify with time.\r\nElectron microscopy:\r\nUnder electron microscopy, the granular material consists of hollow- centered microfibrils, which are elastic fiber precursors. The material is overproduced by numerous fibroblasts that are thought to be actinically activated by sunlight exposure.\r\nImmunoassay:\r\nImmunoassay suggests an abnormal epidermal differentiation due to a decline in the expression of Pax6, K19 keratin, and MUC5AC (a protein coding gene), but an associated increase in K10 and K14 keratin. There is also active proliferation of the squamous cells, as evidenced by positive expression of Ki67, P63, and K16 keratin.\r\nPinguecula may become inflamed due to dryness and irritation, resulting in so-called pingueculitis. The most common causes of such inflammation are:\r\n\r\nMechanical irritation: Irritation by the edge of a contact lens is a frequent cause.\r\nOcular surface disease. \r\n\r\nThe epithelium overlying a pinguecula can vary from atrophic and thinned to hyperplastic and thickened. Pinguecula are unlikely to undergo malignant conversion. However, a lesion that looks atypical should be approached with suspicion. Actinic keratosis, dysplastic changes, and even carcinoma can arise within the epithelium overlying a pinguecula.\r\n\r\nPinguecula may be differentiated from:\r\n\r\nLimbal dermoid.\r\nConjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia.\r\nConjunctival tumour like naevus, melanoma or papilloma."

Preterm is defined by World Health Organization (WHO) as babies born alive before 37 completed weeks of gestation or fewer than 259 days of gestation since the first day of a woman\u2019s last menstrual period (LMP). Normally, a pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks.\r\nAccording to WHO, every year about 15 million babies are born prematurely around the world and that is more than one in 10 of all babies born globally. Almost 1 million children die each year due to complications of preterm birth (2013). Across 184 countries, the rate of preterm birth ranges from 5% to 18% of babies born. In India, out of 27 million babies born every year (2010 data), 3.5 million babies born are premature.\r\nNewborn deaths (those in the first month of life) account for 40 percent of all deaths among children under five years of age. Preterm birth is the world\u2019s number one cause of newborn deaths, and the second leading cause of all child deaths under five, after pneumonia.\r\nMany of the preterm babies who survive suffer from various disabilities like cerebral palsy, sensory deficits, learning disabilities and respiratory illnesses. The morbidity associated with preterm birth often extends to later life, resulting in physical, psychological and economic stress to the individual and the family.\r\nThough occurrence of preterm birth is a global problem, but more than 60% of preterm births occur in Africa and South Asia. In the lower-income countries, on average, 12% of babies are born too early compared with 9% in higher-income countries. Within countries, poorer families are at higher risk. Survival of premature babies also depends on where they are born; almost 9 out of every 10 preterm babies survive in high-income countries because of enhanced basic care and awareness, in sharp contrast to about 1 out of 10 in low-income countries.\r\nMore than three-quarters of preterm /premature babies can be saved with often inexpensive care such as essential care during child birth, antenatal steroid injections (given to pregnant women at risk of preterm labour under set criteria to strengthen the babies\u2019 lungs) and postnatal care like kangaroo mother care (the baby is carried by the mother with skin-to-skin contact and frequent breastfeeding), and basic care for infections and breathing difficulties.\r\nIdentificationof risk factors in women with improved care before, between and during pregnancies; better access to contraceptives and increased empowerment/ education can further decrease the preterm birth rate (the number of preterm births divided by the number of live births)."

                "Management of preterm birth incorporates the specialized care of women during pregnancy and child birth along with care of newborn (preterm) baby.\r\n(a) Care during pregnancy and child birth-\r\nSome women are at increased risk of preterm delivery which can be identified during their antenatal care visits, based on following factors-\r\n\r\nObstetric history (e.g., known uterine or cervical anomaly or previous preterm birth).\r\nPresenting pregnancy characteristics (e.g., hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, diabetes, multiple gestation, bleeding).\r\nYoung adolescents.\r\n\r\nWomen who are identified at risk of preterm delivery or in preterm labour should give birth at a health facility (hospital) where more advanced, specialized care is available for mothers and their babies. The safest time for referral to such type of hospital is when the baby is still in the womb.\r\nOnce preterm labor has started, there are interventions that can prolong pregnancy and improve health outcomes and survival for the premature baby. Interventions to prolong pregnancy include the provision of tocolytic agents that inhibit uterine contractions to suppress labor (e.g., oxytocin antagonists, betamimetics, calcium channel blockers, magnesium sulphate).\r\nThe other three interventions that can be provided during the pregnancy period will help in improving health outcomes of the premature baby: antenatal corticosteroids, antibiotics for prelabour premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), and magnesium sulphate.\r\n\r\nUse of antenatal corticosteroids- Women in preterm labour, before 34 weeks of pregnancy have been completed, should receive steroid injections to speed up the development of the baby\u2019s lungs. The administration of antenatal corticosteroids to pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth (as early as 23 weeks) can reduce the premature baby\u2019s risk of death, respiratory distress and developmental problems.\r\nUse of antibiotics for prelabour premature rupture of membranes (PPROM)- Premature rupture of the membranes is strongly associated with infection of the amniotic membranes contributing to preterm birth and other poor fetal outcomes such as cerebral palsy and chronic lung disease. Antibiotic treatment for PPROM may delay onset of labor for up to 48 hours and reduce neonatal infections.\r\n\r\n(Amoxicillin and clavulanic acid combination (such as co-amoxiclav) should be avoided in women at risk of preterm delivery because of the increased risk of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.*)\r\n\r\nUse of magnesium sulphate- The administration of magnesium sulphate to women at risk of preterm birth before 32 weeks of gestation helps to protect the baby\u2019s brain, reduce rates of cerebral palsy and improve long-term neonatal health outcomes.\r\n\r\n(b)Special care for newborn (preterm) baby-\r\nPreterm baby needs special care because -\r\nPreterm babies are not fully developed to live in the world outside their mother\u2019s womb. Therefore they need special care along with same care that other babies get to overcome the following challenges- \r\nKeeping warm:\r\nPreterm babies lose body heat more easily, which may result in to hypothermia. Hence they need extra energy and care to stay warm and grow. Babies should be kept warm right after birth; they should be dried thoroughly and placed on their mother\u2019s abdomen. After the umbilical cord has been clamped and cut and if they breathe normally they should be put on their mother\u2019s chest, with skin-to-skin contact, until after the first breastfeed. They should not be bathed right away.\r\nBreathing:\r\nThe lungs of preterm babies are not fully developed and lack surfactant (a substance that helps keep the lungs expanded). Many preterm babies start breathing on their own, when they are born, but others need to be resuscitated (newborn resuscitation or ventilation with a bag and mask). If breathing problems persist, they may need additional support from a machine (ventilator) and extra oxygen.Sometimes, some premature babies that have started breathing are not strong enough to continue on their own and exhaust themselves and may stop breathing (apnoea). Constant supervision is required for such babies.\r\nFeeding:\r\nPreterm babies may need additional support for feeding as the coordinated suck and swallow reflex is not yet fully developed. Breast milk is the best nutrition for preterm babies. Babies should be breastfed as soon as possible after birth. Most premature babies who are unable to coordinate the suck and swallow reflex can be fed their mother\u2019s expressed breast milk by cup, spoon or nasogastric tube. Breast is best: just like full-term babies.\r\nInfections:\r\nThe immune systems of preterm babies are not fully developed therefore they are more susceptible to infections. If they get an infection, they have a higher risk of dying.\r\nPreterm babies should be protected from infections by:\r\n\r\nGloves and cutting devices used for clamping and cutting the umbilical cord should be sterile,\r\nEveryone who touches the mother or the baby should have clean hands.\r\nMedical examinations and procedures should only be done if necessary.\r\nBabies who have infections need treatment with antibiotics. \r\n\r\nBrain:\r\nPreterm babies are at risk of bleeding in the brain, during birth and in the first few days after birth. Lack of oxygen can also cause brain injuries. Bleeding or lack of oxygen to the brain can result in cerebral palsy, developmental delays and learning difficulties\r\nEyes:\r\nPreterm babies\u2019 eyes can be damaged by abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina. The condition is usually more severe in very premature babies and if they are given too-high a level of oxygen. This can result in visual impairment or blindness.\r\nCare for preterm babies with complications:\r\nBabies who have additional complications may need to be kept in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Hospitals with NICU can provide specialized care for newborn babies with serious health problems. They have special equipments and specially trained doctors and nurses who provide around-the-clock care for preterm babies, who need extra support to keep warm, to breathe and to be fed, or who are very sick.\r\nAs preterm babies (and full-term babies with low birth weight) need extra warmth and support for feeding, Kangaroo Mother Care is a good technique for these babies, if they do not have other serious problems (breathing well with normal heart rate).\r\nKangaroo Mother Care: is a technique by which the baby is held on an adult\u2019s chest\u2014usually the mother\u2014with skin-to-skin contact, for extended periods of time. The baby is placed on his/her mother\u2019s chest and stays there, day and night, held in place by a cloth that is wrapped and tied at the mother\u2019s back. It is an effective way to meet a premature baby\u2019s needs for warmth, frequent breastfeeding, protection from infection, stimulation, safety and love. It also improves bonding between mothers and babies."

Preeclampsia affects 3\u20135% of pregnancies. Along with preeclampsia, other diseases which are included in the group of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are eclampsia, gestational hypertension and chronic hypertension.\r\nIn Asia and Africa, nearly one tenth of all maternal deaths are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.\r\nIn India, the incidence of preeclampsia is reported to be 8-10% among the pregnant women. According to a study, the prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was 7.8% with preeclampsia in 5.4% of the study population in India*.\r\nPreeclampsia is a pregnancy specific hypertensive disease with multisystem involvement. It is a disorder of widespread vascular endothelial malfunction and vasospasm that occurs after 20 weeks of gestation and can present as late as 4-6 weeks postpartum (after child birth).\r\nAccording to the new guidelines given by American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) in 2013, the diagnosis of preeclampsia does not require the detection of high levels of protein in the urine (proteinuria) along with hypertension. Evidence shows that changes in kidney and liver can occur without signs of proteinuria, and the amount of protein in the urine does not predict how severely the disease will progress.\r\nPreeclampsia is now to be diagnosed by persistent high blood pressure that develops during pregnancy or during the postpartum period and is associated with a lot of protein in the urine or the new development of decreased blood platelets, changes in thekidney or liver function, fluid in the lungs, or signs of brain disorder such as seizures and/or visualdisturbances.\r\nHEELP syndrome and eclampsia are the serious complications of the preeclampsia. The majority of deaths related to preeclampsia can be prevented by providing timely and effective care to pregnant women presenting with such complications."

Preeclampsia is now to be diagnosed by persistent high blood pressure that develops during pregnancy or during the postpartum period that is associated with a lot of protein in the urine or the new development of decreased blood platelets, trouble with thekidney or liver, fluid in the lungs, or signs of brain trouble such as seizures and/or visualdisturbances.\r\nTests advised for evaluation of progress of preeclampsia are: \r\nBlood tests: includes tests for liver and kidney function test, total number of red blood cells, platelet count, and clotting test. \r\nUrine analysis: the dipstick test greater than 1+ protein on a random urine sample(used only if other quantitative methods not available), however single sample of urine, or several urine samples collected over a 24-hour period can be used to determine for protein and creatinine whenever possible.\r\nUltrasonography is used to assess the status of the fetus as well as to evaluate growth of foetus. Apart from transabdominal ultrasonography, umbilical artery Doppler ultrasonography can be performed to assess blood flow for detection of perinatal growth restriction and prematurity.\r\nNonstress test or biophysical profile:A nonstress test is a simple procedure that checks how baby's heart rate changes when baby moves inside the uterus. A biophysical profile is a prenatal ultrasound evaluation of foetal wellbeing involving a scoring system. It combines a foetal ultrasound with a nonstress test to provide more information about baby's breathing, muscle tone, movement and the volume of amniotic fluid around the foetus."

                "Management of pregnant women with preeclampsia without severe features aims with first consideration of safety of women and her foetus and second with delivery of a mature newborn that will not require intensive or prolonged neonatal care. It depends on the results of maternal and fetal evaluation, gestational age, presence of labour, or rupture of membranes, vaginal bleeding and wishes of the women.\r\nAntepartum management-\r\nOnce the diagnosis has made as pregnancy with preeclampsia, women should be evaluated for complete blood count with platelet count, serum creatinine and liver enzyme levels, urine protein (24-hour collection or protein/creatinine ratio). Foetal evaluation can be done with ultrasonography (foetal weight and amniotic fluid index), nonstress test (NST) and biophysical profile (if NST is non reactive).\r\nManagement can occur in hospital or at home with restricted activity and serial maternal and foetal evaluation (continued evaluation).\r\nContinued evaluation consists of following:\r\nFoetal evolution:\r\nDaily kick count, ultrasonography for foetal growth every three weeks, amniotic fluid volume assessment once weekly, NST twice weekly ,bio physical profile( if NST non reactive). (Frequency of these tests can be changed according to clinical findings.)\r\nMaternal evaluation:\r\nBlood pressure assessment: additional BP determination can be done at home or clinic.\r\nLaboratory investigations for CBC, liver enzyme, serum creatinine levels should be done at least once a week.(frequency of these tests can be changed according to clinical finding)\r\nPatients should have a regular diet with no salt restriction.\r\nWomen are instructed to report symptoms of severe preeclampsia (severe headaches, visual changes, epigartic pain, and shortness of breath) at each subsequent visit.\r\nWomen are advised to immediately come to the hospital/referred to the hospital if they develop persistent symptoms, abdominal pain, contractions, vaginal spotting, rupture of membrane, or decreased foetal movement.                                                                   \r\nThe development of new symptoms or signs suggesting severe preeclampsia or severe hypertension (systolic BP of 160 mm Hg or higher, or diastolic BP of 110 mm Hg or higher on repeat measurement) or evidence of foetal growth restriction, increased amount of liver enzymes or decreased platelet count requires immediate hospitalization.\r\nAntihypertensive therapy: There was insufficient evidence about role of antihypertensive drugs on improvements of foetal and maternal out comes in non severe hypertension,( the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines recommended treatment at BP levels at 150 mm Hg systolic or 100 mm Hg diastolic, or both).\r\nBed rest: There may be situations in which different levels of rest, either at home or in the hospital may be indicated for individual women. Prolonged bed rest for the duration of pregnancy increases the risk of thromboembolism (formation of a clot (thrombus) in a blood vessel that may break loose and may obstruct another vessel).\r\nTiming of delivery: In women with preeclampsia without severe features between 34 weeks of gestation and 37 weeks of gestation should be in favour of continued monitoring and delivery to 37 completed weeks of gestation ( in the absence of abnormal foetal testing or other severe conditions such as premature rupture of membranes, preterm labour, or vaginal bleeding).\r\nDelivery is indicated in the following conditions:\r\n\r\n37 or more weeks of gestation\r\nSuspected abruptio placentae (detachment of placenta from uterus)\r\n34 weeks or more of gestation, plus any one of the following:\r\nProgressive labour or rupture of membranes\r\nUltrasonographic estimate of foetal weight less than fifth percentile\r\nOligohydramnios (less amount of amniotic fluid )\r\nPersistent biophysical profile 6/10 or less (upper limit 10/10)\r\n\r\nIn women with preeclampsia, a delivery decision should not be based on the amount of proteinuria or change in the amount of proeteinuria only, but all other indicated tests should be kept under consideration\r\nMagnesium sulfate prophylaxis should be initiated if there is progression to severe disease.\r\nManagement of Severe preeclampsia-\r\nFor women with preeclampsia with severe hypertension during pregnancy (sustained systolic BP of at least 160 mm of Hg or diastolic BP of at least 110 mm Hg),the use of anti hypertensive therapy is recommended.\r\nIn pregnancy with severe preeclampsia, the parenteral (intravenous/intramuscular) administration of magnesium sulfate is recommended.\r\nIn women with severe preeclampsia at term, early delivery is recommended.\r\nFor women with severe preeclampsia at less than 34 weeks of gestation with stable maternal and foetal conditions, it is advised that pregnancy should be continued at facilities with adequate maternal and neonatal intensive care units. Whenever there is an indication, delivery may be considered. \r\nFor women with severe preeclampsia at or beyond 34 weeks of gestation and with unstable maternal and foetal conditions irrespective of gestational age, quick delivery is recommended after maternal stabilization.\r\nPregnancy with severe preeclampsia before 23-24 weeks of gestation, delivery after maternal stabilization is recommended. Expectant management is not advised.\r\nAntenatal corticosteroid administration should be considered in women with severe preeclampsia receiving expectant management at 34 weeks or less of gestation for foetal lung maturity.\r\nThe mode of delivery: should be determined by foetal gestational age, foetal presentation, cervical status, and maternal- foetal condition."

                "Pellucid marginal degeneration (PMD) is a bilateral (may be asymmetric), progressive, inferior crescentic peripheral thinning of the cornea. There is no vascularisation, infiltration or scarring in the area of involved cornea. Band of thinning measures about 1 to 2mm in width and extends from 4 to 8 o\u2019clock position (about 6 to 8mm), leaving a normal band of 1 to 2mm from the limbus. The condition affects both men and women between 20 to 40 years of age. The condition results in high irregular astigmatism and rarely may develop acute hydrops (stromal oedema due to leakage of aqueous humour through breaks in Descemet\u2019s membrane) or even perforation. It differs from keratoconus in that it has no iron ring, its thinning is in inferior part without a cone; and the corneal protrusion is located above (rather than) in the area of thinning. Pellucid marginal degeneration and keratoconus may exist in the same eye and in different eyes of the same patient. This association in the same patient suggests that pellucid marginal degeneration, keratoconus and keratoglobus (generalised thinning and globular protrusion of the cornea) may be varying spectrum of the same pathophysiology rather than separate disease processes. The central cornea is usually of normal thickness, and the epithelium overlying the area of thinning is intact. Rarely, it may involve superior part of cornea.\r\nSchalaeppi (1957), coined the term pellucid marginal degeneration to describe a progressive and non-inflammatory peripheral corneal thinning disorder. The word \u2018pellucid\u2019, meaning clear, was used to denote the clarity of the cornea in this condition despite the presence of ectasia.\r\nThe cause of pellucid marginal degeneration is not clearly established, but collagen abnormalities such as that occur in keratoconus have been reported. The condition is rare, but there may be a considerable underestimation of the incidence because these patients are often misdiagnosed as having keratoconus. Early cases of pellucid marginal degeneration may be diagnosed with corneal topography/videokeratography (maps the surface curvature of the cornea) only."

                "Diagnosis depends upon history, slit-lamp examination, pachymetry (measures thickness of the cornea) and corneal topography.\r\nPatients with PMD typically present with progressive reduction in vision or longstanding poor vision, resulting from large magnitude of irregular, against-the-rule astigmatism. Against-the-rule astigmatism is the condition in which horizontal meridian is steepest and it can be corrected by a minus cylinder in the vertical axis or the plus cylinder in the horizontal axis. There may be sudden reduction in vision and photophobia due to acute hydrops, being produced by breaks in Descemet\u2019s membrane.\r\nPMD is a bilateral condition but unilateral cases have also been described. This condition most commonly involves inferior cornea, but involvement of superior, nasal and temporal quadrants of cornea has been reported as well.\r\nClinical signs of PMD:\r\n\r\nRefraction and keratometry: Refraction and keratometry shows against-the-rule astigmatism.\r\nPMD features: PMD is characterised by a typical narrow, clear band of corneal thinning about 1 to 2mm in width which extends from 4-o\u2019clock position to 8-o\u2019clock position (6 to 8mm in size). The degree of thinning is usually severe and may cause up to 80% loss of stromal tissue. Between limbus and thinned band-like region there is typically a 1 to 2mm wide region of uninvolved normal cornea which is usually clear. The corneal protrusion is most marked just superior to the area of thinning and usually with normal thickness of the central cornea. Descemet\u2019s folds, usually concentric with the inferior limbus, may develop which disappear with pressure on the cornea.\r\n\r\nUnlike keratoconus, PMD usually does not show signs of Fleischer\u2019s ring, corneal infiltration, vascularisation, scarring or lipid deposition. Since there is no obvious cone, cornea does not exhibit Munson\u2019s sign (a V-shaped deformation of the lower eyelid when the eye turns downward) or Rizutti\u2019s sign (a sharply focussed beam of light near nasal limbus produced by lateral illumination of the temporal limbus).\r\n\r\nCorneal topography or videokeratography: Corneal topography is the gold standard in detecting corneal ectasia. The use of topography allows the detection of early and subclinical ectasia which is important in diagnosis as well as in pre-operative corneal laser refractive surgery assessment. Videokeratography shows low corneal power along the central vertical axis which increases as the inferior cornea is approached, and high corneal power along the inferior oblique meridians. There are various topography devices like TMS-1 which uses pacido rings method, Orbscan II utilises slit-scanning and Placido ring reflection, Oculus Pentacam uses Scheimpflug photography for topography with pachymetry, and Visante Omni combines Placido ring and optical coherence tomography (OCT) for topography with pachymetry. The hallmark of corneal topography in PMD is an obvious flattening of the cornea along the vertical meridian. Inferior-central cornea in PMD shows a \u2018beer-belly\u2019 appearance when viewed from the side. Topography shows that this inferior peripheral steepening extends into the mid-peripheral, inferior oblique corneal meridians in a classic \u2018crab-claw\u2019, \u2018butterfly\u2019 or \u2018kissing doves\u2019 appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nClassification or stages of PMD:\r\nBeing a rare disorder no clearly defined, guidelines have been proposed to categorise the severity of the condition. However, the ectatic process advances over time and it is suggested to have three stages:\r\n\r\nMild.\r\nModerate.\r\nAdvanced.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistopathology:\r\nLight microscopy may show irregularity in epithelium with oedema, increase in stromal mucopolysaccharides as well as an irregular Bowman\u2019s membrane with ruptures at places. There may be folds in Descemet\u2019s membrane and stromal thinning.\r\nElectron microscopy may show breaks in Bowman\u2019s layer, irregular arrangement of stroma with the presence of extracellular, granular electron-dense deposits. There is absence of inflammatory cells.\r\nScanning electron microscopy may reveal unusual electron-dense areas of fibrous long-spacing collagen in the peripheral thinned areas, scattered amongst regions of mostly normal collagen.\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis:\r\nPMD is most frequently misdiagnosed as the more common corneal ectatic condition of keratoconus.\r\n\r\nKeratoconus: Keratoconus is characterised by para-central corneal thinning and ectasia so that the cornea takes the shape of a cone. Pellucid marginal degeneration may be differentiated from keratoconus in most cases by the inferior band like location of the thinning on slit lamp (bio-microscopy) examination and by the classic butterfly pattern on videokeratography. In contrast to keratoconus, patients with pellucid marginal degeneration have no iron ring, no Vogt striae, and no central corneal thinning or scarring of the protruding cornea, and corneal protrusion is located above rather than in the area of thinning.\r\nKeratoglobus: Keratolobus causes circumferential 360\u02da thinning of the cornea, more marked at the limbus, and the entire cornea protrudes compared with regional thinning in keratoconus and inferior paralimbal thinning in pellucid marginal degeneration. Corneas with keratoglobus usually show diffuse thinning, varying from one-third to one-fifth of the normal corneal thickness at the mid-peripheral area. Vogt\u2019s striae, sub-epithelial scarring, Fleischer\u2019s ring, lipid deposition and corneal vascularisation are rarely found in the corneas with keratoglobus. The cornea can also become opaque and oedematous from breaks in Descemet\u2019s membrane.\r\nTerrien\u2019s marginal degeneration: Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration is a non-inflammatory condition characterised by slowly progressive, bilateral, marginal corneal ectasia typically beginning superiorly which can then progress circumferentially. Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration most commonly affects males in their mid-twenties. Early signs on slit lamp examination include marginal opacification with peripheral vascularisation. Marginal thinning then begins parallel to the limbus, forming a \u2018gutter-like furrow\u2019 in the clear gap between opacification and limbus. Epithelium remains intact and does not ulcerate over the furrow and lipid deposition occurs as the furrow deepens. Pseudo-pterygium may develop near the furrowed area. As the disease continues, the thinning may extend to the inferior cornea, sparing the interpalpebral periphery. There is relative steepening of interpalpebral peripheral cornea, resulting in against-the-rule or oblique astigmatism. Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration progresses very slowly, frequently taking several years. Vast majority of patients with Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration complain of mild, intermittent ocular irritation only. Very rarely does it causes acute ocular inflammation with pain.\r\nFurrow degeneration: Furrow degeneration, like pellucid marginal degeneration has an intact epithelium and the area of corneal thinning is not vascularised, at least in the acute phase. The area of thinning in furrow degeneration is much closer to the limbus with virtually no intervening zone of normal cornea. Furrow degeneration may on occasion involve superior part of cornea, and there may be an associated adjacent area of scleritis. The edges of the furrow are steeper than the gradual attenuation seen in pellucid marginal degeneration, and there may be a corneal infiltrate adjacent to the area of thinning. Furrow degeneration may have strong association with rheumatoid arthritis.\r\nMooren\u2019s ulcer: Mooren\u2019s ulcer, an idiopathic peripheral corneal melting disorder, is characterised by associated severe pain and may be accompanied by an epithelial defect over the area of thinning. It may be accompanied by corneal vascularisation adjacent to the area of thinning in the acute phase. Usually the site of involvement is the inferior limbus, with the ulceration then spreading circumlimbally and then centrally, eventually involving the entire cornea. At the end stages of Mooren\u2019s ulcer, there is vascularisation and scarring of cornea with stromal thinning to less than half of the original corneal thickness.\r\nRheumatologic disorder affecting cornea: Rheumatologic disorder affecting cornea is also a peripheral melting disorder. It is characterised by pain and may be accompanied by an epithelial defect over the area of thinning. It may also be accompanied by corneal vascularisation adjacent to the area of thinning in the acute phase.\r\nContact lens-induced warping of cornea: Contact lens-induced warping of cornea may mimic the appearance of pellucid marginal degeneration on corneal topography."

Patients with high astigmatism may be prescribed with high refractive index sphero-cylindrical glasses.\r\nSoft (hydro gel) toric contact lenses: Soft toric (lenses for astigmatism) contact lenses may be useful in the early mild stages of the condition only, usually before the progression of irregular astigmatism. Hybrid (rigid gas permeable and hydro gel combined) contact lenses viz. Saturn II lenses, SoftPerm lenses and SynergEyes lenses have also been used.\r\n\r\nModerate stage:\r\n\r\nRigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses: Rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses may be required for moderate cases of PMD. Large amount of irregular against-the-rule astigmatism results in unstable lens centration and excessive inferior edge stand-off. Therefore, larger-diameter RGP lenses may provide satisfactory lens stability and tolerance with good visual acuity. \u2018Bi-toric\u2019 RGP contact lenses have also been used successfully. Specialised back surface design lenses may correct large amounts of corneal astigmatism and may provide good visual acuity. RGP and soft contact lens with \u2018sector management control\u2019 allow peripheral lens geometry to be customised to complement the anterior surface of the ectatic cornea.\r\n\r\nAdvanced stage:\r\n\r\nRigid gas permeable (RGP) scleral contact lenses: In advanced stages, adequate RGP lens centration may be difficult to achieve as additional corneal steepening increases the possibility of lens dislocation with blinking. Rigid gas permeable (RGP) scleral contact lenses have certain advantages.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantages of scleral contact lenses are:\r\n- They are supported by the sclera thus reducing lid sensation.\r\n- They provide good centration, thus high-powered lenses remain static.\r\n- They are unlikely to dislodge upon blinking.\r\n- They vault the area of the cornea affected by the disease making irregular topography less of a problem to fit.\r\n- There is less risk of foreign body entrapment.\r\n\r\nDisadvantages of scleral contact lenses are:\r\n- Poor oxygen transfer to cornea.\r\n- Difficulties in application as compared to corneal RGP lenses.\r\n- Complicated manufacturing processes.\r\n- Relatively few practitioners are experienced in fitting such lenses.\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy: \r\n\r\nKeratoplasty: Keratoplasty is considered for patients with PMD whose vision is inadequate with contact lenses or for patients who are intolerant to lens.\r\n\r\nPenetrating keratoplasty: In general, patients with PMD are usually poor candidates for penetrating keratoplasty as the corneal thinning occurs close to the limbus. As a result, large eccentric grafts are required and must be positioned very close to the limbus thus increasing the chances of graft rejection, suture-induced complications and corneal neovascularisation. Penetrating keratoplasty also induces large amounts of post-operative astigmatism which may be difficult to correct due to variation in the graft-host thickness.\r\nDeep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK): In deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK), the anterior third to two-thirds of the cornea is replaced with donor tissue.\r\nLamellar crescentic keratoplasty: In lamellar crescentic keratoplasty, crescent-shaped donor lamellar cornea is used. Lamellar crescentic keratoplasty was used earlier to treat PMD.\r\nLamellar thermo- keratoplasty (LTK): Lamellar thermo-keratoplasty (LTK) is an adaptation of lamellar crescentic keratoplasty. This involves thermal shrinkage of the host lamellar bed, prior to the placement and suturing of the crescent-shaped donor lamellar cornea.\r\nLamellar crescentic resection (LCR): Lamellar crescentic resection (LCR) involves excision of the abnormally thinned stroma and then re-approximation of the near-normal thickness edges. The major advantage is that no donor tissue is required.\r\nCorneal wedge excision/resection: Corneal wedge excision/resection is similar to lamellar crescentic resection, except that it involves full thickness corneal tissue removal followed by re-apposition of the remaining normal thickness cornea using sutures.\r\nEpikeratoplasty: Epikeratoplasty is a rare form of surgery used for PMD. This is a type of on-lay lamellar keratoplasty in which a lens made of human corneal tissue is sutured onto the anterior surface of the cornea to change its anterior curvature and refraction.\r\n\u2018Tuck-in\u2019 lamellar keratoplasty: \u2018Tuck-in\u2019 lamellar keratoplasty refers to a central lamellar keratoplasty with intrastromal tucking of the peripheral flange.\r\n\r\nIntra-stromal corneal ring segment inserts (INTACS): Intrastromal corneal ring segment inserts (INTACS) helps in reducing the myopia and astigmatism and improving spectacle- corrected visual acuity. Intrastromal corneal ring segment inserts (INTACS) involves incorporation of two semi-circular plastic rings into the peripheral corneal stroma. In PMD, the ectatic corneal tissue has a thinner structure and is potentially more easily flattened as compared to normal eyes.\r\nCombined riboflavin-ultraviolet type A rays (UVA) collagen cross-linking: Combined riboflavin-ultraviolet type A rays (UVA) collagen cross-linking consists of photo-polymerisation of corneal stroma by combining vitamin B2 (photosensitising substance) with UVA. This process increases rigidity of corneal collagen and thus reduces the likelihood of further ectasia.\r\nToric phakic intraocular lens (TPIOL): The use of toric phakic intraocular lens (TPIOL) has also been reported.\r\n\r\nPMD patients presenting with acute hydrops or corneal perforation may be treated with glue tissue adhesive, bandage soft contact lenses, crescentic lamellar keratoplasty, penetrating keratoplasty or deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty.\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nPellucid marginal degeneration progresses slowly over the years and may result in severe visual deterioration. Being rare, no large scale longitudinal studies are reported.\r\nSince pellucid marginal degeneration affects corneal periphery, contact lens fitting and surgical correction is more difficult as compared to keratoconus."

                "Presbyopia is the gradual age- related loss of accommodative amplitude which begins early in life and culminates in complete loss of accommodation by about 50 years of age. The word presbyopia is derived from the Greek words presbus (meaning old man) and ops (eye).\r\nAccommodation is a dynamic, optical change in the dioptric power of the eye allowing the point of focus of the eye to be changed from distant to near objects. Accommodation is the ability to increase the refractive power of the optical system of eye. It occurs to produce a clear image of near objects. For accommodation, the ciliary body contracts, the lens zonules relax, and the crystalline lens assumes a more spherical shape, which increases its refractive power. Other than presbyopia, disorders that affect accommodation are quite rare. Regardless of the cause, it causes blurred vision for near objects and there is eyestrain with prolonged near work.\r\nIn an un-accommodated, emmetropic (with no refractive error) eye, distant objects at or beyond what is considered optical infinity for the eye (6 meters) are focused on the retina. For an object closer to the eye, the eye accommodates for a clearly focused image on the retina. Myopic eyes, being too long for the optical power, are unable to attain a sharply focused image for objects at optical infinity. Myopes can focus clearly on objects closer to the eye than optical infinity without accommodation (i.e. objects at their far point). In contrast, young hypermetropes are only able to focus clearly on objects at optical infinity through an accommodative increase in the optical power, provided their accommodative amplitude exceeds the amount of hypermetropia.\r\nOptical requirements of accommodation: The optical power of the crystalline lens increases (i.e. the focal length of lens decreases) during accommodation. As a result, the eye changes focus from distance to near so that the image of near object focuses on retina. The dioptric change in power of the eye defines accommodation and accommodation is measured in units of dioptres (D). A dioptre is reciprocal of meter and is a measure of the vergence of light. Light rays converging towards a point image are designated to have positive vergence. An object at optical infinity subtends zero vergence at the cornea. Cornea and crystalline lens add positive vergence to bring light towards a focus on the retina. If the eye accommodates from an object at optical infinity to an object 1.0 meters in front of the eye, this represents 1.0 D of accommodation. If the eye accommodates from infinity to 0.5 meters in front of the eye, this is 2 D of accommodation. Thus, the accommodative response is the increase in optical power the eye undergoes, to change focus from an object at optical infinity to the near object.\r\nThe accommodative apparatus of the eye consists of ciliary muscle, ciliary body, choroid, anterior and posterior zonular fibers, the lens capsule and the crystalline lens.\r\nAlthough presbyopia is age related, the age of onset varies around the world. For example, presbyopia develops earlier in people who live closer to the equator. Specifically, the age of onset of presbyopia is noted to be 37 years in India. Further studies show that the important variable is ambient temperature rather than latitude. Higher the ambient temperature, earlier is the onset of presbyopia.\r\nPresbyopia (\u2018old- age sight\u2019) occurs when the near point of accommodation recedes to a point where it is difficult or impossible to accommodate sufficiently for reading or other close work. For most people, close work becomes difficult when the amplitude of accommodation is less than 5 dioptres (corresponding to a near point of accommodation of 20 cm).\r\nOnce presbyopia occurs, it gradually increases over a period of 10 to 12 years and then stabilises. A presbyope usually requires a + 1.00 D (dioptres) of reading addition in the age of early forties, levelling off to about + 2.50 D at about the age of 55 years."

Thus, if a patient is corrected to emmetropia, the amount of near blurring should be similar in each eye.

                "Presbyopia is caused due to loss of the fine balance of forces that permit the accommodative structures to bring a change in optical power of the lens in the young eye.\r\nWith advancing age, there is decline in the ability of the eye to accommodate or change its focus.\r\nNeural pathway for accommodation:\r\nAccommodation is associated with convergence and miosis forming the triad of \u2018near reflex\u2019.\r\nThe neural pathway for accommodation probably originates in the caudal part of the Edinger- Westphal or third nerve parasympathetic nucleus in the midbrain. These areas receive input from the cerebral cortex and pretectum. Fibers from the third nerve nucleus, responsible for accommodation, then travel to the ciliary ganglion, where they synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic fibers going to ciliary body and iris sphincter. Then via short ciliary nerves, they reach to the intrinsic muscles of the eye.\r\nParasympathetic control is of much greater clinical importance. However, experiments have shown that the ciliary body receives sympathetic input as well. Since accommodation is mediated almost exclusively via parasympathetic pathways, it is antagonised best with muscarinic receptor (type of acetylcholine receptors) blockers. With muscarinic antagonists, paralysis of accommodation (cycloplegia) is always associated with dilatation of pupil (mydriasis).\r\nMuscarinic antagonists commonly used are:\r\n\r\nTropicamide: Tropicamide has a very short half- life and should not be used to conduct cycloplegic refraction.\r\nCyclopentolate: Cyclopentolate has sufficient half- life and may be used for cycloplegic refraction, even in children.\r\nHomatropine.\r\nScopolamine (hyoscine). \r\nAtropine.\r\n\r\nHomatropine, scopolamine (hyoscine) and atropine are generally used for therapeutic (treatment) purposes.\r\nThere is great variability in the normal levels of accommodation. Accommodative ability decreases with age. Children have great accommodative capabilities and presbyopia is rare before thirty five years of age.\r\nMechanism of accommodation:\r\nHelmholtz in 1855 provided the description of accommodative mechanism. When the young eye is un-accommodated and focused for distance, the ciliary muscle is relaxed. Resting tension on anterior zonular fibers inserting around the lens equator, apply an outward directed tension to hold the lens in a relatively flattened and un-accommodated state. For near focus, the ciliary muscle contracts, the inner apex of the ciliary body moves forward and towards the axis of the eye. This stretches the posterior attachment of the ciliary muscle and releases resting tension on all zonular fibers around the lens equator. The lens capsule then moulds and provides the force to cause the lens to become accommodated. The accommodative increase in optical power of the lens comes about from an increase in the lens anterior surface curvature, and to lesser extent, of the posterior surface curvatures.\r\nWhen accommodative effort is over, the ciliary muscle relaxes and the elasticity of the posterior attachment of the choroid pulls the ciliary muscle back into its flattened and un-accommodated state. The outward movement of the apex of the ciliary body once again increases the tension on the anterior zonular fibers around the lens equator to pull the lens via the capsule into a flattened and un-accommodated form.\r\nAlternative theory of mechanism of accommodation:\r\nSchachar (1993) proposed that zonular tension is increased during accommodation in young subjects in contrast with the classic Helmholtz\u2019s theory. The basic assumptions are:\r\n- During near accommodation, the lens equator moves outward causing an increase in lens diameter.\r\n- The equatorial lens diameter increases with age due to natural growth of the lens.\r\n- Presbyopia is caused by decrease of the distance between lens equator and ciliary muscle leaving not enough space for the lens equator to move outward with accommodation.\r\n\r\nOcular changes resulting in presbyopia:\r\nChanges that occur in the eye resulting in presbyopia are broadly divided into three categories:\r\n\r\nLens and lens capsule- based theories: Lens and lens capsule- based theories consider changes in the elasticity and compliance of the lens and its capsule. There is continued deposition of the lens fibers within the lens as it ages, causing the lens to become compact and stiff. A major factor in the loss of accommodation may be the increased stiffness of the ageing lens with inability to respond to accommodative stimuli. The near point of accommodation gradually recedes from about 7 cm at the age of 10 years to about 20 cm at the age of 40 years and it recedes further to about 40 cm at about the age of 50 years.\r\nExtralenticular theories: Extralenticular theories consider changes in the ciliary muscle and choroid.\r\nGeometric theories: Geometric theories consider changes in the geometry of the zonular attachments to the lens.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther causes of diminished near vision are:\r\n\r\nUncorrected hypermetropia where all the accommodation is used for clear distant vision.\r\nUse of local or systemic parasympatholytic drugs (e.g.atropine).\r\nAphakia and pseudo-phakia.\r\nInternal ophthalmoplegia."

                "Diagnosing presbyopia is straightforward and age of the patient is a major consideration. A simple reading test using well- illuminated text of graded sizes at a standard distance may be helpful both in characterising the degree of near- vision and in determining the appropriate refractive power.\r\nAccommodation may be measured by determining the accommodative amplitude or the accommodative range.\r\nMonocular accommodative amplitude may be measured by following methods:\r\n\r\nSubjective push- up method: Subjective push- up method involves a small target (like near letter chart) being brought forward toward the eye until it blurs. It is the near point of accommodation. The reciprocal of the distance at which the target blurs is the accommodative amplitude in dioptres.\r\nPrince rule: Prince rule combines a scaled ruler with a near addition of + 3 D (dioptres), and it puts the far point of an emmetrope (a person with no refractive error) at 33 cm. The target on Prince rule is brought forward until it blurs. Taking account of addition of + 3, this distance is converted into dioptres of accommodative amplitude.\r\nNegative powered trial lenses: The test uses a distance letter chart and lenses of increasing minus spherical power to induce accommodation. More minus sphere is added until the subject can no longer overcome the minus lenses with accommodation. The amount of minus sphere that can be overcome represents the accommodative amplitude.\r\n\r\nAccurate objective measurements of accommodation may be done statically or dynamically with auto-refractors, refractometers or aberrometers. Dynamic optometers provide a real-time graphic display of the accommodative response and can provide an indication of how much the accommodative response varies over time. Objective methods provide a true measure of accommodative amplitude of the eye.\r\nAccommodation may also be stimulated by topically applied muscarinic agonists (e.g. pilocarpine) and the resulting accommodative response measured periodically over 30- 45 minutes using a refractometer or an auto-refractor until the maximal accommodative response is attained.\r\nAssessment of accommodative range:\r\n\r\nAccommodative range: Accommodative range refers to the range of distances which can be viewed clearly by using accommodation. It is expressed without correction for emmetropia. A + 2 hypermetrope with 4 D of accommodation would have an uncorrected accommodative range from infinity to 50 cm. A minus 2 myope with similar accommodative amplitude would have an accommodative range from 50 cm to about 17 cm.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferential Diagnosis:\r\nPresbyopia is the most common cause of accommodative dysfunction.\r\nPresbyopia should be differentiated from other conditions with decreased accommodation like:\r\n\r\nTrauma along neuro-anatomical pathway: Trauma to the parasympathetic nuclei in the midbrain, to supra-nuclear structures, or to the third nerve may produce symptoms of asthenopia (eye strain).\r\nAdie\u2019s syndrome: Adie\u2019s syndrome is characterised by one eye with a pupil that is larger than normal and constricts slowly in bright light (tonic pupil), along with the absence of deep tendon reflexes, usually in the Achilles tendon. Adie\u2019s syndrome is usually associated with decrease in accommodation.\r\nPharmacological cycloplegia: Pharmacological cycloplegia also produces temporary accommodative dysfunction.\r\nSystemic medications: Systemic medications may cause decrease in accommodation. These medicines often have anti-cholinergic side effects. Examples include phenothiazines and anti-parkinsonian drugs.\r\n\r\nUnlike presbyopia, increased accommodation is rarely seen as in:\r\n\r\nHorner Syndrome: Several experiments have shown that ciliary body also receives sympathetic input. This is shown clinically by the increased accommodative amplitude seen in the affected eye of patients with Horner Syndrome.\r\nMiotic agents: Miotic agents such as pilocarpine may cause an abnormally proximal near point.\r\nAccommodative spasm: Accommodative spasm is a functional disorder characterised by blurred vision for distance, diplopia, episodic esotropia (inward turning of eye), miosis (small pupil), and an abnormal near point of accommodation."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nIt is important to correct refractive error properly to put the far point at infinity so that ocular system is emmetropic for distance.\r\nMedical therapy:\r\nManagement of presbyopia involves use of plus lenses for near work either in a bifocal or as reading glasses only. Most problems with reading addition of plus glasses result from over- correction for the near distance.\r\nCorrection to emmetropia and the use of trial frames to determine the proper power give good results.\r\n\r\nSpectacle correction: Reading glasses, bifocals, progressive glasses, and even trifocals, are the most common methods of correction for eyes that can no longer focus on near objects, and are the most versatile option.\r\nContact lenses: Different contact lenses are available for the presbyopes. These are either bifocal or multifocal contact lenses, but these have received a mixed response by the users. An additional alternative is mono-vision contact lenses, where the refractive power of one eye is set for focus at a distance and the other eye for focusing near objects. Although image is clear for each eye, there is concomitant loss of depth perception. A general drawback to the use of contact lens for presbyopia is the decrease in tear production with ageing.\r\n\r\nSurgical refractive presbyopia management:\r\nNatural accommodation has both accommodative and pseudo-accommodative components. Accommodation (i.e. real change in optical power) should be distinguished from the ability to see clearly for near. Depth of focus bifocality or multifocality (e.g. multifocal intraocular lens) may provide a variable degree of functional near vision. Such vision is known as pseudo-accommodation.\r\nTreatment may be performed by replacing the crystalline lens with a multifocal lens after cataract surgery. If the crystalline lens is still clear, it may be preferable to treat presbyopia in a way that allows for preserving lens.\r\nI. Pseudo-accommodative procedures:\r\n\r\nMono-vision: Mono-vision refers to correcting dominant one eye to emmetropia and the other to myopia between minus 1 and minus 2 D, which can be achieved by excimer laser surgery. In hypermetropia, a steepening of the cornea with overcorrection of one eye may be performed by laser thermokeratoplasty (LTK). The limitation of mono-vision is the lack of a possibility for correction of intermediate distance vision without simultaneously affecting near and distance vision.\r\nMultifocal excimer laser: Multifocal corneal ablation with laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is currently used almost exclusively in hypermetropic and emmetropic eyes.\r\nIntra-corneal implants: Exact control of the lamellar corneal cut is obtained with microkeratome and femtosecond laser technologies. Benefit of these intra-corneal implants is their reversibility. If the implant is not well tolerated, or cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation is to be performed later, it can be removed, thereby restoring the original shape of the cornea.\r\nMultifocal intraocular (IOL) lenses: \r\n\r\n- Refractive multifocal IOLs: Refractive bifocal or multifocal IOLs have on their optic two or more ring- shaped spherical zones of different refraction. The near part is usually located in the center of the lens optic. With accommodative miosis, the near part comes into play when looking at near targets, and the distance part when looking at far points. Efficacy of this depends on the centration of the IOL and diameter of the pupil.\r\n- Diffractive multifocal IOLs: Diffractive multifocal IOLs part away the light to two focus points, one for near and one for distance. They have a diffractive anterior or posterior surface with concentric rings for the diffraction of incoming light rays, which are focused onto a far and a near point. The bifocality is largely independent of pupil diameter and centration.\r\nSome modern multifocal IOLs use a combination of refractive and diffractive principles.\r\nII. Accommodative procedures:\r\n\r\nAnterior ciliary sclerotomy and sclera expansion: Anterior ciliary sclerotomy and sclera expansion procedure is based on alternative theory of the mechanism of accommodation, proposed by Schachar. Accordingly, it seems logical to increase this space for the lens equator to move outward.\r\nPotentially accommodating IOLs: Accommodating IOLs are designed to transform the movement of the ciliary muscle into a dynamic change of ocular dioptric power. Accommodative IOLs are based on the principle of optic shift. Haptic (which hold the lens in place) contraction of the ciliary muscle is supposed to shift the IOL optic anteriorly. This allows for only small accommodative amplitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nMost patients with symptoms of eye strain do well with plus power glasses for reading. Plus power requirements increase until patients attain the age of early sixties, and then stabilise."

Research reveals that women with a body mass index (BMI) of 30kg/m2 or above are nearly three times as likely to have PMS as women who are not obese. Women who smoke cigarettes are likely to have more severe PMS symptoms.\r\nPMS affects women with ovulatory cycles. Older adolescents tend to have more severe symptoms than younger adolescents do. Women in their fourth decade of life tend to be affected most severely. PMS completely resolves at menopause."

                "If symptoms of PMS are mild to moderate, they can be relieved by life style changes that mainly include healthy diet and exercise. Behavioral counseling and stress management may help the patients regain control during times of high emotional disturbances.\r\nHealthy diet-Simple changes in diet may help relieve the symptoms of PMS:\r\n\r\nEat a diet rich in whole grains like whole grain bread, pasta, cereals, barley, brown rice and beans and lentils. Whole grains contain complex carbohydrates that reduce mood symptoms and food cravings.\r\nAdd fruits, leafy green vegetables and low fat cheese, yogurt and milk to your diet (calcium rich foods).\r\nReduce intake of fat, salt, and sugar.\r\nAvoid caffeine and alcohol.\r\nEat six small meals a day rather than three large ones, or eat slightly less at three meals and add three light snacks. These modifications will keep blood sugar level stable and will help with symptoms.\r\nDrink plenty of fluids (water or juice, not soft drinks, alcohol, or other beverages with caffeine).\r\n\r\nExercise- Exercise regularly and not just during the days that symptoms are there. At least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise most days of the week helps in reducing PMS symptoms. Aerobic exercise includes brisk walking, running, cycling, and swimming, increases heart rate and lung function. It may reduce fatigue and depression.\r\nRelaxation techniques- Areas of stress should be identified and finding ways to relax and reduce stress can decrease the PMS symptoms. Relaxation techniques that include breathing exercises, meditation, and yoga may help in managing pre menstrual symptoms.\r\nGetting enough sleep with regular sleeping habits is important in healthy life style modifications. Regular sleeping habits means wake up and go to sleep at the same time every day, including weekends.\r\nDietary supplements in the form of calcium, magnesium, vitamin E may help reduce symptoms of PMS.\r\nQuit smoking if you smoke.\r\nIf symptoms are so intense that interfere with the routine life, consult the doctor. In severe cases medicines may be recommended that include-\r\n(a) Hormonal contraceptives: these are the drugs that prevent ovulation and may be effective in relieving physical symptoms.\r\n(b) Antidepressants- These drugs can help lessen mood symptoms.\r\n(c) Anti-anxiety drugs- If anxiety is a major PMS symptom, these drugs may be used.\r\n(d) Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help reduce pain. Long term use of NSAIDs is not recommended.\r\n(e) Diuretics are drugs that help the body to lose excess water through the kidneys. These medicines have been used to reduce weight gain, breast swelling, and bloating associated with PMS."

                "Pseudophakia refers to the presence of an intraocular lens (IOL) implant. The IOL may be inserted at the time of cataract surgery for the removal of crystalline lens or it may be put as a secondary procedure to correct aphakia. The IOL may be placed in the anterior chamber (anterior-chamber IOL) or posterior chamber (posterior-chamber IOL).\r\nRefractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the crystalline lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye.\r\nEmmetropia is the condition where the eye has no refractive error and requires no correction for distance vision. In an emmetropic eye, rays of light parallel to the optical axis focuses on the retina. The far point in emmetropia (point conjugate to retina in non- accommodating state) is optical infinity, which is 6 meters. Ametropia (refractive error) results when cornea and lens inadequately focus the light rays. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.\r\nThe term ametropia (refractive error) describes any condition where light is poorly focused on light sensitive layer of eye, resulting in blurred vision. This is a common eye problem and includes conditions such as myopia (near- sightedness), hypermetropia (far- sightedness), astigmatism, and presbyopia (age- related diminution of vision). A person who is able to see without the aid of spectacles or contact lenses is emmetropic.\r\nPrevalence and distribution of ametropia vary greatly with age. Majority of children in early infancy are found to be somewhat hypermetropic. During the school years, children begin to become myopic in increasing numbers.\r\nIOLs are made up of acrylic or quality Perspex i.e. poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA). The lenses are about 4- 6 mm in diameter and are biconvex or plano- convex. Lens power calculations for primary implantation necessitate axial length measurement with ultrasonography, keratometry and the use of standard tables. A stronger lens may be required in children. Lens loops are usually made up of flexible methyl-methacrylate. Foldable IOLs made up of silicone or various polymers of acrylic are also available for insertion through a small incision following cataract surgery by phacoemulsification.\r\nA patient who needs 12.5 D in aphakic spectacles would need about 21 D of an IOL in posterior chamber of eye. The average magnification of an IOL in posterior chamber is about 1.5%, compared with the original crystalline lens. For an anterior chamber IOL the average power is about 18 D, and the magnification is about 2 %. Some patients may detect this disparity by alternately covering each eye. Almost everyone can achieve binocular vision with one eye pseudophakia and other phakic (eye with crystalline lens). An IOL may be implanted at the time of cataract surgery or as secondary implantation at a later date. Advantages of IOL includes\r\n- Minimal after- care of patients.\r\n- Rapid return of binocular vision.\r\n- Minimal aniseikonia (different image size seen by the eyes).\r\n- Normal peripheral vision."

                "Pseudophakia is the condition being produced by implantation of an intraocular lens in the eye.\r\nIOL:\r\n\r\nDesign: Currently available IOLs are either biconvex, plano- convex or meniscus. Majority of implanted lenses are biconvex. In addition to minimising the effects of tilt, decentration and spherical aberration, a convex posterior surface of a biconvex lens may reduce the migration of lens epithelial cells which produces opacification of the posterior capsule. Positive meniscus lens is rarely used because when it is tilted or decentered, the induced astigmatism and power change is dramatic. A 10\u02da- 15\u02da tilt can induce enough regular and irregular astigmatism to make the spectacle correction intolerable.\r\nEdge design: Reflections, flashes and shimmering peripheral lights are related to the edge design. Most lenses had rounded edges to avoid reflected images.\r\nOptical transmission: After removal of crystalline lens, light with wavelengths of 300- 400 nm reaches to the retina. Ultraviolet light filtration is done in almost all IOLs to reduce blue light hazard to the eye.\r\nMaterial: IOLs are mainly made up of PMMA, silicone or acrylic. Silicone and acrylic lenses are foldable so that they can be implanted through small incisions (2.2 to 3.5 mm in length). Higher the refractive index, flatter is the curvatures of lens. Due to flatter curvature, acrylic lens is the thinnest of all.\r\nSpecial lenses: There are three special types of IOL viz. Multifocal, toric and aspheric.\r\n\r\n- Multifocal IOLs produce an image that is about 30% reduced in contrast to mono-focal lenses.\r\n- Toric IOL lenses are spherocylindrical glasses similar to spectacles. The magnitude of the cylinder in the IOL should be about 1.4 times the astigmatism in the cornea to neutralise corneal astigmatism completely.\r\n- Aspheric IOL lenses are designed to minimise spherical aberration and to restore asphericity of eyes in young patients.\r\n\r\nCalculation of IOL power: \r\nPrior to cataract surgery, the power of the IOL needed to give desired postoperative refraction is determined by measuring corneal curvature and axial length in a mathematical formula.\r\nCorneal curvature is measured commonly by keratometry. Small variability of the keratometry reading gives an IOL power to within 0.5 D. Variability in the measurement of the axial length tends to be the main source of discrepancy in the calculation of IOL power.\r\nWhen the cornea is irregular (due to corneal pathology or previous corneal or refractive procedures), a better prediction of the required IOL power may be obtained using corneal topography (photokeratoscopy or videokeratography) rather than keratometry to measure the corneal curvature. Corneal topography generates many more data points to be used in calculation of IOL power. Corneal topography may be used to assess the magnitude, location and regularity of pre- existing astigmatism. Incision in the peripheral part of steep axis produces a central flattening effect and reduces astigmatism. Change in corneal contour is less for the more peripheral incisions in the sclera or limbus.\r\nIOL calculations that require axial length:\r\nTheoretical formulas: These formulas for IOL power calculation has not changed since its original description by Fyoderov et al. in 1967. Several investigators have presented these formulas in different forms. Six variables used in the formula are\r\n\r\nNet corneal power.\r\nAxial length.\r\nIOL power.\r\nEffective lens position.\r\nDesired refraction.\r\nVertex distance.\r\n\r\nSeveral additional measurements of the eye are taken, but only seven preoperative variables (axial length, corneal power, horizontal corneal diameter, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, preoperative refraction, and age) were found to improve significantly the prediction of effective lens position. Third generation formulas Holladay 1, Hoffer Q and SRK/T and newer Holladay 2 are much more accurate than previous formulas. Older formulas such as SRK1, SRK2, and Binkhorst 1do not give desired result if the central corneal power is measured incorrectly.\r\nRefractive lens exchange (RLE) for high myopia and hypermetropia with normal cornea and no previous keratorefractive surgery: \r\nSince there is loss of accommodation and the patients are relatively young, a small degree of myopia (minus 0.50 D) may be desirable so that dependence on spectacles may be reduced.\r\nFor myopia, third- generation theoretical formulas give excellent predictions if the axial length is stable and the measurements are accurate.\r\nFor hypermetrpia, the Holladay 2 formula is used. The use of this formula may reduce the prediction error in these cases to less than 1 D. Accurate measurements of axial length and corneal power are especially important in these cases.\r\nMethods to determine axial length: Axial length may be determined by optical methods and ultrasonic methods. Ultrasonic measurement is less dependent on the density of the cataract.\r\nPatients with previous keratorefractive surgery:\r\nThe number of patients who had keratorefractive surgery (radial keratotomy, photorefractive keratectomy, or laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis) is increasing steadily. These groups of patients present a difficult challenge. Instruments used to measure corneal power make incorrect assumptions for corneas that have irregular astigmatism. Due to this, the calculation method and the trial hard contact lens method are the most accurate, followed by corneal topography, automated keratometry, and manual keratometry.\r\n\r\nCalculation method: For this, three parameters must be known viz. Net corneal power, refraction status before keratorefractive procedure, and the stabilised refraction after the keratorefractive procedure. This method usually is most accurate because the preoperative net corneal power values and refraction usually are accurate to \u00b1 0.25 D.\r\nTrial hard contact lens method: The trial hard contact lens method requires a plano hard contact lens with a known base curve and a patient whose cataract does not prevent refraction to about \u00b1 0.50 D. The spheroequivalent refraction is calculated by normal refraction. The refraction is then repeated with hard contact lens. If the spheroequivalent refraction does not change with contact lens, then the power value for cornea of the patient must be same as that of the base curve of the plano contact lens in place.\r\nCorneal topography: Corneal topography measure more than 5000 points over the entire cornea and more than 1000 points within the central 3 mm of cornea. This allows a very accurate determination of the anterior surface of the cornea. However, it does not provide any information about the posterior surface of the cornea. Most IOL calculations use a net index of refraction (1.3333) and the anterior radius of the cornea to calculate the net power of the cornea. Topography provides an excellent overview of central and peripheral corneal shape. Corneal topography does not provide accurate corneal power following keratorefractive surgery (radial keratotomy, photorefractive keratectomy, or laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis) with optical zones of 3 mm or less. In radial keratotomy with larger optical zones, the topography becomes more reliable. Calculation method and hard contact lens trial method are always more reliable.\r\nAutomated keratometry: Automated keratometers usually are more accurate than manual keratometers for corneas of small optical zone of about 3 mm for radial keratotomy. Automated keratometry measurements following photorefractive keratectomy or laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis, yield better values of the front radius of the cornea. Like corneal topography, measurements are still not accurate.\r\nManual keratometry: Manual keratometers provide the least accurate measure of central corneal power following keratorefractive surgery, because the area that they measure usually is larger than 3.2 mm in diameter. Thus, measurements in this area are extremely unreliable for radial keratotomy corneas that have optical zones less than or equal to 4mm.The manual keratometer has similar problem with photorefractive keratectomy or laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis as with topography or automated keratometers and, thus, is less accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIOL calculations using net corneal power values and preoperative refraction: \r\nIn a standard cataract surgery with IOL implantation, the preoperative refraction is not very helpful for calculation of the power of an implant, because as the crystalline lens is removed, so the diopteric power is being removed and then replaced. Cases in which power is not reduced in the eye (such as secondary implant in aphakia, piggy-back IOL in pseudophakia, or a minus IOL in the anterior chamber of a myopic phakic eye), the necessary IOL power for a desired postoperative refraction may be calculated from the corneal power and pre- operative refraction. Measurement of axial length is not necessary.\r\nThe formula used for calculation of IOL power uses following variables\r\n\r\nExpected lens position in millimetres (distance from corneal vertex to principal plane of IOL).\r\nIOL power in dioptres.\r\nNet corneal power in dioptres.\r\nPreoperative refraction in dioptres.\r\nDesired postoperative refraction in dioptres.\r\nVertex distance in millimetres of refraction.\r\n\r\nSecondary piggy-back IOL in pseudophakia: \r\nIn patients who have significant residual refractive error following primary IOL implant, it is often easier surgically and more predictable optically, to leave the primary implant in place and calculate the secondary piggy-back IOL power to achieve the desired refraction. This method does not require knowledge of the power of the primary implant or of the axial length. This formula works for both plus or minus lenses.\r\nPrimary minus IOL in the anterior chamber of a myopic phakic eye:\r\nThe calculation for a minus IOL in the anterior chamber is the same as for the aphakic calculation of an anterior chamber lens, with the exception that the power of the lens is negative. In the past, these lenses were reserved for high myopia that could not be corrected by radial keratotomy or photorefractive keratectomy. Because successful laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis procedures have been performed in myopias up to minus 20 D, these lenses may be reserved for myopia that exceeds this power.\r\n\r\nOptical refractive state in pseudophakia:\r\nIt depends upon the power of the Implanted IOL. Postoperatively, patient may have\r\n\r\nEmmetropia: Emmetropia or normal refractive state is produced when the power of IOL matches with the refractive state of the eye. This is the most sought after ideal situation. Patients need correction only for reading or near vision.\r\nConsecutive myopia: This is produced when the implanted IOL overcorrects the refraction of the eye. Such patients require correction with glasses for correction of myopia for distance vision and may or may not require glasses for reading or near vision, depending upon the degree of myopia.\r\nConsecutive hypermetropia: This condition is produced when the IOL implanted has power less than the refractive state of the eye. Such patients require correction with convex glasses for distance and an additional plus correction for reading or near vision.\r\nAstigmatism: Surgically induced astigmatism of varying degree may also be present in pseudophakia."

Most commonly hypertelorism (widely set eyes) may result in pseudoexotropia.\r\nInterpupillary distance (IPD): Patients with wide interpupillary distance (IPD) give the appearance of divergent deviation.\r\nPositive angle kappa: Pathologic ectopia of the macula temporally due to traction of retina may produce a positive angle kappa. Positive angle kappa results in nasal displacement of the light reflex on the cornea simulating exotropia. Pseudoexotropia due to positive angle kappa is mostly seen in retinopathy of prematurity, which results in temporal dragging of the macula. It may also be seen in ectopic macula resulting from high myopia, toxocara retinal scars or congenital retinal folds.\r\nExophthalmos: Exophthalmos gives the appearance of divergent deviation.\r\n\r\nIII. Pseudohypertropia: Pseudohypertropia may be due to\r\n\r\nFacial asymmetry: Facial asymmetry which produces an appearance of vertically misaligned eyes where one eye appears to be higher than the other.\r\nOrbital tumours: Certain orbital tumours of the orbital floor may produce hypoglobus (downward displacement of eyeball) simulating vertical misalignment.\r\nTrauma: Trauma to the orbital floor may also produce hypoglobus simulating vertical misalignment.\r\n\r\nIV. Miscellaneous causes:\r\n\r\nPtosis may give appearance of vertical deviation.\r\nFacial asymmetry.\r\nPalpebral fissure asymmetry.\r\nDermatochalasis (lax eyelid skin and muscle).\r\nAbnormal head posture.\r\nIll-fitting spectacles.\r\nHeterochromia iridis (a difference in colour of iris of an eye).\r\nColoboma of iris (a fissure or gap in the iris).\r\nAnisocoria (a difference in size of the pupils).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRisk factors:\r\n\r\nPrematurity: Prematurity may cause retinopathy of prematurity which may result in temporal dragging of macula producing positive angle kappa and pseudoexotropia.\r\nFacial morphology: Prominent epicanthal folds in asian children results in pseudoesotropia.\r\nOrbital tumours: Certain orbital tumours may result in pseudohypertropia.\r\nOrbital trauma: It may produce hypoglobus resulting in pseudohypertropia in some patients.\r\nChorioretinal infections: These may produce chorioretinal scarring with temporal dragging of macula resulting in pseudoexotropia."

                "Clinical diagnosis of pseudostrabismus requires ruling out the presence of true intermittent or constant strabismus.\r\nPatients with pseudostrabismus require full investigation as the prevalence of strabismus is higher in those diagnosed with pseudostrabismus.\r\nDiagnosis depends upon clinical history, physical examination and certain diagnostic tests.\r\nDetailed history regarding weight at birth, gestational age, health of child, any procedure for retinopathy of prematurity may give diagnostic clues. History of initial presentation aided by photographs of the child may assist in documenting the onset, detecting the stability of the condition and confirming the diagnosis.\r\nA good physical examination comprises of inspection of eye and adnexal morphology.\r\nBoth normal and pathologic variations in palpebral fissure may produce the appearance of strabismus, despite normal alignment of the visual axis of two eyes. Diagnosis of pseudoesotropia in infants with large epicanthal folds is probably the most common reason. Family members may believe that strabismus is present because they do not see much of white sclera on the nasal aspect of the eye compared to the temporal aspect. After careful examination, most parents may often be convinced that the position and shape of the eyelids and ocular adnexal structures may produce the appearance of strabismus. Doubting parents may be convinced by tightening the epicanthal fold by pinching the bridge of the nose.\r\nSimilarly, abnormalities involving the lateral canthal area may create impression of exotropia.\r\n\r\nDiagnostic tests\r\nI. Visual acuity evaluation: Every patient presenting with pseudostrabismus should have complete evaluation of visual acuity.\r\nII. Motor evaluation: It comprises of tests such as\r\n\r\nHirschberg\u2019s light reflex test: This gives a rough objective estimate of the angle of manifest strabismus and is especially useful when fixation in the deviating eye is poor.\r\n\r\n- A pen-torch is shown in to the eyes from a distance of about one arm and the patient is asked to fixate the light. The corneal reflection of the light is more or less in the center of pupil of the fixating eye, but will be decentered in the squinting eye, in the direction opposite to that of deviation.\r\n- The distance of the corneal light reflection, if any, is noted. In orthotropic eyes (eyes without squint), there is no decentering of the light reflex.\r\n\r\n\r\nCover-uncover test:\r\n\r\nCover test: This is done to detect heterotropia. It is good to begin the near test first by using light and then the accommodative target. Then the test is done for distance as follows\r\n- The patient fixates a straight-ahead target.\r\n- If a right deviation is suspected, the examiner covers the fixing left eye and notes any movement of the right eye to take up fixation.\r\n- No movement indicates orthotropia or left heterotropia.\r\n- Adduction of the right eye to take up fixation indicates right exotropia and abduction indicates right esotropia.\r\n- Vertical movement indicates vertical hyper- or hypotropia.\r\n- The test is repeated in the opposite eye.\r\nUncover test: It detects heterophoria. It is performed both for near and far.\r\nMost examiners perform cover and uncover test sequentially, hence the term cover-uncover test.\r\n\r\nAlternate cover test: It is a dissociation test which reveals the total deviation when fusion is suspended. It is performed after the cover-uncover test. The occluder is shifted quickly back and forth from one eye to other, several times. After the cover is removed, the speed and smoothness of recovery is noted as the eyes return to their pre- dissociated state. A patient with well compensated heterophoria will have straight eyes before and after the test has been performed, whereas a patient with poor control may decompensate to manifest deviation.\r\nOcular movements: It is necessary to test the function of each extra-ocular muscle by testing uniocular and binocular movements.\r\n\r\nIII. Sensory evaluation: Complete sensory evaluation may give clue to sensory development. Detection of fixation preference for one eye may be performed by vertical prism test.\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis\r\nTrue strabismus should be ruled out by conducting thorough examination before reaching to the conclusion of pseudostrabismus.\r\nPatient should be followed-up with re-evaluation every 6 months because true strabismus may sometimes develop in patients with pseudostrabismus.\r\nFactors causing pseudostrabismus may be present when there is a true strabismus and may mask or accentuate its presence. Doubtful cases should be followed up. Certain findings are strong indicators that a child should be observed even though no convincing evidence of strabismus is found. These include\r\n- Family history of strabismus or refractive error.\r\n- Presence of significant heterophoria. Even a small esophoria when present is significant.\r\n- A tendency to squeeze eye in sunlight indicates a possible intermittent childhood exotropia.\r\nOnce a pseudostrabismus is diagnosed, the parents should be explained the reason for the apparent deviation and reassured."

As the flat nasal bridge develops, this excessive epicanthal skin is raised and the condition corrects by itself. Hence, no treatment is required except for follow-up for disappearance of pseudoesotropia.\r\nHowever, true manifest squint is treated if it is associated with pseudostrabismus.\r\n\r\nPrognosis\r\nThe natural course of pseudostrabismus is variable. Most of the cases of pseudoesotropia resolve usually by the age of two to three years, because the epicanthal folds diminish as the bridge of the nose enlarges.\r\nPseudostrabismus secondary to positive or negative angle kappa typically persists in adulthood."

More than one type of bacteria may be involved in puerperal sepsis. Bacteria may be either nosocomial, endogenous or exogenous.\r\nNosocomial infections are acquired in hospitals or other health facilities and may come from the hospital environment or from the patient's own flora.\r\nEndogenous bacteria- These bacteria are normally present in the vagina and rectum without causing any disease (e.g. some types of streptococci and staphylococci, E.coli, clostridium welchii). Endogenous bacteria can be transmitted from vagina to uterus;\r\n\r\nduring pelvic examinations and use of instruments,\r\nfollowing obstructed labour due to tissue damage and,\r\nprolonged ruptured of membrane because microorganisms can enter the uterus.\r\n\r\nExogenous bacteria-These bacteria are introduced into the vagina from the outside by unclean hands and unsterile instruments, sexually transmitted infections, foreign substances inserted in to vagina.

                "Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a complication of delivery and the most common cause of maternal death, accounting for about 35% of all maternal deaths worldwide. These deaths have a major impact on the lives and health of the families affected.\r\nPPH is commonly defined as a blood loss of 500 ml or more within 24 hours after birth, while severe PPH is defined as a blood loss of 1000 ml or more within the same timeframe according to World Health Organisation (WHO). A small blood loss that makes the woman haemodynamically unstable is also termed as PPH.\r\nPPH is a major cause of morbidity and mortality with in the first 24 hours following delivery and this is regarded as primary PPH; whereas any excessive bleeding from the birth canal occurring between 24 hours and 12 weeks postnatally (after delivery) is termed as secondary PPH.\r\nIn practice, blood loss after delivery is seldom measured and it is not clear whether measuring blood loss improves the care and outcome for the women. In addition, some women may require interventions to manage PPH with less blood loss than others if they are anaemic.\r\nPPH may result from failure of the uterus to contract adequately (atony), genital tract trauma (vaginal or cervical lacerations), uterine rupture, retained placental tissue, or maternal bleeding disorders. Uterine atony is the most common cause and consequently the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide.\r\nThe maternal mortality ratio in developing countries in 2015 is 239 per 100000 live births versus 12 per 100000 live births in developed countries. Thus 99% of all maternal deaths occur in developing countries with more than half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and almost one third occur in South Asia. Very small proportion, 1% of maternal deaths occur in the developed world. There are large disparities between countries, but also within countries; maternal deaths are more in low income group and rural areas as compare to high income group and urban areas.\r\nAbout 830 women die from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications around the world every day. 52% of maternal deaths are attributable to three leading preventable causes-haemorrhage, sepsis, and hypertensive disorders. WHO statistics suggest that 25% of maternal deaths are due to PPH. Postpartum bleeding is the quickest of maternal killers; can kill even a healthy woman within two hours, if not treated.\r\nIncidence of PPH is reported as 2% - 4% after vaginal delivery and 6% after cesarean section; with uterine atony being the cause in about 50% cases. Every year about 14 million women around the world suffer from PPH.\r\nIn India sample registration scheme (SRS), during survey of causes of death 1998, reported that PPH was a major cause of maternal mortality and responsible for 30 % of maternal deaths and according to SRS 2001-2003, PPH accounts 38 percent of maternal deaths. Estimates of maternal mortality ratio in India done by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in 2003 also showed PPH as a leading cause of maternal mortality in study population. \r\nA combination of quality antenatal care, skilled care at birth by active management of third stage of labour, the availability of high quality emergency obstetric care (with trained medical personnel and adequate infrastructure) and improved access to these services are essential to save many maternal lives."

                "Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) may result from various reasons such as failure of the uterus to contract adequately (atony), genital tract trauma (vaginal or cervical lacerations), uterine rupture, retained placental tissue, or maternal bleeding disorders.\r\nCauses of primary PPH-\r\na) Uterine atony is failure of the uterus to contract following delivery. It is the most common cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Atonic bleeding occurs from the placental site when the uterus (myometrial muscles) does not contract and retract properly and thus the blood vessels are not compressed and bleeding is not controlled.\r\n\r\nAny condition that interferes with uterine contraction, such as a retained placenta, remnants of placental tissue, membranes and blood clot will predispose to atonic bleeding. Full bladder, antepartum haemorrhage due to placenta praevia (low lying attachment of placenta) or placental abruption (separation of placenta from uterus prior to delivery) may also cause PPH.\r\nOverstretched uterus as seen in high parity, multiple pregnancy, polyhydramnios (Increased amount of amniotic fluid), large baby, fibroids may be the risk factors for atonic PPH.\r\nPoor myometrial contraction can result from fatigue due to prolonged labor or rapid forceful labor, especially if stimulated. It can also result from the inhibition of contractions by drugs (such as halogenated anesthetic agents, nitrates, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, magnesium sulfate, beta-sympathomimetics, and nifedipine). Anaemia is also a risk factor for PPH.\r\nIntrauterine death with fetus retained in uterus for three to four weeks, severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia may also lead to PPH.\r\n\r\nb) Genital trauma: Damage to the genital tract may occur spontaneously or through manipulations used to deliver the baby. Injuries during labour to perineum, vaginal walls, cervix, uterus, episiotomy, caesarean section can also cause PPH. Trauma may occur following very prolonged or vigorous labor, especially if the patient has relative or absolute cephalopelvic disproportion and the uterus has been stimulated with medicines (oxytocin or prostaglandins). Cervical laceration is most commonly associated with forceps delivery. Trauma also may occur following extrauterine or intrauterine manipulation of the fetus.\r\nUterine rupture is most common in patients with previous cesarean delivery scars.Any uterus that has undergone a procedure resulting in a total or thick or partial disruption of the uterine wall should be considered at risk for rupture in a future pregnancy.\r\nc) Tissue: Uterine contraction and retraction leads to detachment and expulsion of the placenta. Complete detachment and expulsion of the placenta permits continued retraction and optimal occlusion of blood vessels.\r\nRetention of a portion of the placenta and membranes, failure of complete separation of the placenta (placenta accrete) and its variants, placenta previa may cause PPH. The placenta is more likely to be retained at extreme preterm gestations (especially &lt; 24 week) and significant bleeding can occur.\r\nd)Coagulation problems: Women with pre-existing bleeding disorders and women taking therapeutic anticoagulants are at increased risk of PPH. Abnormalities related to bleeding disorder (clotting system) may be preexistent or acquired; such as thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) may be related to preexisting disease called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, or acquired secondary to HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count)- a complication of preeclampsia, abruptio placentae, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and sepsis.\r\nAn underlying bleeding disorder should be considered in a woman with any of the following: menorrhagia since menarche, family history of bleeding disorders, personal history of notable bruising without known injury, bleeding from the oral cavity or gastrointestinal tract without obvious lesion, or epistaxis (nosebleed) of longer than 10 minutes duration (possibly requiring packing or cautery).\r\nMost cases of PPH have no identifiable risk factors. PPH usually has a single cause, but more than one cause is also possible.\r\nSecondary PPH is the abnormal or excessive bleeding from the birth canal between 24 hours and 12 weeks postnatally. It is often associated with infection (endometritis).\r\nFactors that prevent women from receiving or seeking care during pregnancy and child birth-\r\n\r\nPoverty\r\nDistance\r\nLack of information\r\nInadequate services\r\nCultural practices\r\n\r\nThese are the barriers that limit access to quality maternal health services; must be identified and addressed at all levels of the health system to improve maternal health."

                "Diagnosis of PPH is usually performed by closely observing the pregnant women during child birth and afterwards. After childbirth, blood loss and other clinical parameters should be closely monitored. When estimating the percentage of blood loss, consideration should be given to body weight and the original haemoglobin level (PPH may be aggravated by pre-existing anaemia).\r\n\r\nBlood volume depends on the body weight. Approximate blood volume (in litres) equals body weight in kilograms divided by 12.\r\nVisually estimating the amount of blood loss may lead to underestimation. There is not enough evidence though to recommend the measurement of blood loss over clinical estimation.\r\nBlood collection drapes for vaginal deliveries and weighing swabs are more accurate than visual blood loss estimation.\r\nParticipating in clinical reconstructions may encourage early diagnosis and prompt treatment of postpartum haemorrhage.\r\nWritten and pictorial guidelines may help staff working in labour wards to estimate blood loss.\r\n\r\nRapid recognition and diagnosis of PPH is essential to successful management. Resuscitative measures and treatment of the underlying cause must start quickly before sequelae of severe hypovolemia develop.\r\nInvestigations-\r\n\r\nComplete blood count for diagnosis of anaemia during antenatal period and labour.\r\nBlood typing and antibody screening testsduring antenatal period. \r\nCross matching of blood for a patient at high risk of PPH such as previous severe PPH, placenta previa, possible placenta accreta, multiple previous cesarean deliveries, known coagulation disorders, or severe thrombocytopenia.

                "As the majority of women who experience PPH complications have no identifiable clinical risk factors, it is recommended that active management of the third stage of labour (AMTSL) be offered to all women during childbirth, whenever a skilled provider is assisting with the delivery.\r\nThe three components of the active management of third stage of labour (AMTSL):\r\n1. Oxytocic drugs should be offered routinely in the management of the third stage of labour in all women. Prophylactic oxytocic drugs have been found to reduce the risk of PPH by about 60%. If oxytocin is not available, oral misoprostol should be given. Misoprostol can be given by community health worker (ASHA) who may be present in the community during home delivery cases*.\r\nIf bleeding is not controlled after use of oxytocin, it is recommended to switch over to the next uterotonic ergot derivatives (methergine) or sublingual misoprostol. (Ergot derivatives (methergine) are contradindicated in hypertensive disorders for the prevention of PPH).\r\n2. Late cord clamping (performed approximately 1 to 3 minutes after birth) is recommended for all births while initiating simultaneously essential new-born care.\r\n3. Controlled cord traction is the recommended method for the removal of the placenta. Uterine massage following the delivery of the placenta is included in AMTSL, where skilled birth attendants are available.\r\nManagement of Postpartum haemorrhage-\r\nInitial assessment is performed and basic treatment should be instituted as follows:\r\n\r\nCall for help\r\nAssess airway, breathing, circulation (ABC)\r\nProvide supplementary oxygen\r\nObtain intravenous line\r\nStart fluid replacement with intravenous crystalloid fluid\r\nMonitor blood pressure, pulse and respiration\r\nCatheterize bladder and monitor urinary output\r\nAssess need for blood transfusion\r\nStart intravenous oxytocin infusion\r\nOrder laboratory tests-complete blood count, coagulation screen, blood grouping and cross-match\r\n\r\nObserve factors related to bleeding and determine cause,\r\n(a) If uterine atony is suspected:\r\n\r\nUterine massage; ((Uterine packing is not recommended for the treatment of PPH due to uterine atony after vaginal delivery);\r\nbimanual uterine compression;\r\nexternal aortic compression; and\r\nballoon or condom tamponade.\r\n\r\nIf the woman is not responding to the treatment or a treatment cannot be administered at the facility, she should be transferred to a higher-level facility with on-going intravenous uterotonic infusion, legs elevated to improve blood supply to vital organs and keep the woman worm. Accompanying attendant should rub the woman\u2019s abdomen continuously and, if necessary, apply mechanical compression.\r\nIf mechanical and pharmacological measures fail to control the haemorrhage, surgical measures are instituted:\r\n\r\nCompression sutures\r\nBilateral ligation of uterine arteries\r\nBilateral ligation of internal iliac (hypogastric) arteries\r\nHysterectomy\r\n\r\n(b) If Placenta delivered incomplete\r\n\r\nOxytocin\r\nManual exploration to remove fragments\r\nGentle curettage or aspiration\r\nIf bleeding continues, manage as uterine atony.\r\n\r\n(c) If placenta is not delivered:\r\n\r\nAdditional oxytocin in combination with controlled cord traction\r\n\r\nIf whole placenta still retained\r\n\r\nManual removal with prophylactic antibiotics\r\n\r\n(d) PPH due to lower genital tract trauma: excessive bleeding or shock with contracted uterus-\r\n\r\nLook for lower genital tract trauma with repair of tears; and evacuation and repair of haematoma.\r\nIf bleeding continues administer tranexamic acid.\r\n\r\n(e) Uterine rupture or dehiscence: excessive bleeding or shock-\r\n\r\nTreat for uterine rupture or dehiscence with laparotomy for primary repair of uterus and Hysterectomy if repair fails.\r\nIf bleeding continues administer tranexamic acid.\r\n\r\n(f) Uterine inversion: uterine fundus not felt abdominally or visible in vagina-\r\nTreat for uterine inversion:\r\n\r\nImmediate manual replacement\r\nHydrostatic correction\r\nManual reverse inversion (use general anaesthesia or wait for effect of any uterotonic to wear off)\r\nIf treatment is not successful, laparotomy is advised to correct inversion.\r\nIf laparotomy correction is not successful then hysterectomy is performed.\r\n\r\n(g) Clotting disorder: bleeding in the absence of above conditions, Treat for clotting disorder as necessary with blood products.\r\nSecondary PPH is the abnormal or excessive bleeding from the birth canal between 24 hours and 12 weeks postnatally.

                "Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is defined as a chronic neuropathic pain that persists for three or more months following acute Herpes zoster (shingles) infection. It is a severe painful secondary phase, which may develop three to six months after the resolution of initial phase of Herpes zoster (HZ) infection. Pain has a dermatomal distribution and is confined to same dermatome as the rash. Herpes zoster infection results from activation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV) which remains latent in dorsal root ganglia since the first infection of chickenpox (varicella). Pain frequently precedes Herpes zoster infection (pre-herpetic neuralgia), and outlasts the herpetic rash by some weeks. It is more common in older individuals (develops in up to 75% of patients over 70 years of age) and is less common in individuals younger than fifty years of age.\r\nPost-herpetic neuralgia subsides eventually on its own. However, it may make patients suffer for years and may leave a band of anaesthetic skin. It may lead to muscle weakness as well, if it affects major motor nerve.\r\nPost-herpetic neuralgia is associated with persistent and, very often, refractory neuropathic pain. The neuralgia is excruciating with superimposed lancinating paresthesias. Pain may be constant or intermittent, aggravated by minor stimulus (allodynia) such as heat or touch, and is worse at night. The agony of pain leads to insomnia, anorexia, and changes in mood (severe depression).\r\nPost-herpetic neuralgia may produce multiple types of pain in patient e.g.\r\n\r\nConstant aching, deep, or burning pain\r\nParoxysmal lancinating pain\r\nHyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain)\r\nAllodynia (pain associated with non-painful stimuli)\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-herpetic neuralgia is a psychosocial condition with a significant impact on the psychological, social, and physical functioning of an individual."

                "Management\r\nPHN is an exceptionally complex drug resistant neuropathic pain. It results from changes in central and peripheral nervous system somatosensory processing.\r\nAim is to treat patient with Post-herpetic neuralgia within first 72 hours of the rash, in order to reduce both acute neuralgia (AN) and PHN.\r\nPHN is one of the most difficult pain syndromes to treat. The reason why PHN occurs in some patients and not in others, is not known. The condition occurs more frequently in older patients, and also following acute Herpes zoster infection of the trigeminal cranial nerve, as compared to acute Herpes zoster involving thoracic region. It is said that aggressive treatment of acute Herpes zoster infection helps in avoiding PHN.\r\n\r\nPreventive vaccination: \r\nA live attenuated vaccine to boost immunity to VZV and reducing the risk of HZ, is recommended for adults older than 60 years of age. It significantly reduces both HZ and PHN.\r\n\r\nMedical therapy:\r\n\r\nAntiviral drugs: Antiviral drugs such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir may reduce both acute neuralgia (AN) and PHN. These drugs reduce viral shedding and help in resolution of symptoms.\r\nAnticonvulsant gabapentin: Gabapentin is effective in management of PHN. The mechanism of action of gabapentin is unknown.\r\nAnticonvulsant Pregabalin: Pregabalin reduces release of excitatory neurotransmitters. Treatment with pregabalin results in significant improvement, as is seen in controlled study.\r\nTricyclic anti-depressants (TCAs): Tricyclic anti-depressants block certain receptors and inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, and thus block the painful stimulus. Examples are amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine and imipramine. Serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as venlafaxine and duloxetine have given promising results in the treatment of PHN. Recent studies have shown that venlafaxine may be of some benefit in patients who cannot tolerate other anti-depressants. Due to incomplete efficacy and side effects of monotherapy, many trials have been conducted to have a combined drug therapy. For example, combination of nortriptyline and gabapentin have been tried.\r\nOpioids: Opioids such as morphine and tramadol are shown to relieve pain of PHN. Earlier evidence favoured TCAs but latest controlled trials support opioids over TCAs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTopical therapy:\r\nDue to the associated side effects of systemic therapy, the focus has shifted to topical therapy. It is a convenient and pain-free self-administration by the patient. There is reduced frequency of administration, reduced systemic exposure due to limited absorption from the skin surface, and enhancement of patient compliance.\r\nLocal topical therapy includes\r\n\r\nLidocaine: 5% Lidocaine patch is a safe and efficient option of local therapy in case of localised neuropathic pain (LNP). Lidocaine patch is a targeted peripheral analgesic. It has high safety, efficacy, and tolerability and is a chosen treatment in case of local neuropathic pain.\r\nCapsaicin: 8% Capsaicin patch may be used in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain either alone or in combination of other medicines. However, capsaicin may cause transient adverse effects such as erythema and pain.\r\nTopical and intranasal analgesic pharmacotherapy: Topical and intranasal analgesic pharmacotherapy may be used in place of systemic therapy. Intranasal 10% ketamine may be combined with topical 6% gabapentin, 10% ketoprofen, 5% lidocaine, or 10% ketamine cream.\r\nGabapentin: 6% Gabapentin gel patches have been tried. It is a recent advance in the treatment of PHN. Topical gabapentin provided rapid improvement of symptoms.\r\nTranscutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS): Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation is a recent advance in the management of PHN. Patients refractory to medical therapy may be treated with TENS. Patients with TENS report a significant decrease in pain. It is seen that whether use of TENS or antivirals, either alone or in combination, cannot completely prevent PHN. However, TENS is found to be most successful in reducing the incidence of subacute herpetic neuralgia.\r\nUltrasound-guided musculocutaneous peripheral nerve block: A patient with excruciating pain and not responding to any treatment was selected. Ultrasound-guided musculocutaneous peripheral nerve block helped in control of symptoms due to PHN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\nSurgical approaches such as stereotaxic trigeminal tractotomy and dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) treatment procedures have been described in the treatment of PHN."

                "Postpartum depression (PPD) is depression that occurs to a mother after a childbirth. PPD is defined as an episode of non-psychotic depression with onset within 1 year of childbirth. PPD can happen any time after childbirth. It often starts within 1 to 3 weeks after a childbirth and may last for weeks or months at a time.\r\nThe word \"postpartum\" means \"after birth,\" so \"postpartum depression\" is talking only about depression after the baby is born. For many women, this term is correct: they start feeling depression sometime within the first year after they have the baby. But some women start to feel depression while they're still pregnant and the term \"perinatal depression\" is used to describe this situation. The word \"perinatal\" describes the time during pregnancy or just after birth.Researchers believe that depression is one of the most common problems women experience during and after pregnancy. Perinatal depression affects as many as one in seven women.\r\nThis type of depression does not only affect mothers. Sometimes new fathers alsoexperience postpartum or prenatal depression.\r\nFeelings of postpartum depression are more intense and last longer than those of \u201cbaby blues\u201d. It is a term used to describe the worry, sadness, and tiredness many women experience after having a baby. \u201cBaby blues\u201d symptoms typically resolve on their own within a few days.\r\nMothers with postpartum depression experience feelings of extreme sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that may make it difficult for them to complete daily care activities for themselves or for others.\r\nPostpartum depression is a common complication of childbearing and as such represents a considerable public health problem affecting women and their families and make it an important medical condition to diagnose, treat and prevent."

                "The patterns of symptoms in women with postpartum depression are similar to those in women who have depression unrelated to childbirth, apart from the fact that the content may focus on the delivery or baby.\r\nSome of the more common symptoms a woman may experience include:\r\n\r\nFeeling sad, hopeless, empty, or overwhelmed\r\nCrying more often than usual or for no apparent reason\r\nWorrying or feeling overly anxious\r\nFeeling moody, irritable, or restless\r\nOversleeping, or being unable to sleep even when her baby is asleep\r\nHaving trouble concentrating, remembering details, and making decisions\r\nExperiencing anger or rage\r\nLosing interest in activities that are usually enjoyable\r\nSuffering from physical aches and pains, including frequent headaches, stomach problems, and muscle pain\r\nEating too little or too much\r\nWithdrawing from or avoiding friends and family\r\nHaving trouble bonding or forming an emotional attachment with her baby\r\nPersistently doubting her ability to care for her baby\r\nThinking about harming herself or her baby.\r\n\r\nPostpartum depression is different from the baby blues-\r\n\r\nThe \u201cbaby blues\u201d is a term used to describe the feelings of worry, unhappiness, and fatigue that many women experience after having a baby. Babies require a lot of care, so it\u2019s normal for mothers to be worried about, or tired from, providing that care. Baby blues, which affects up to 80 percent of mothers, includes feelings that are somewhat mild, last a week or two, and go away on their own.\r\nWith postpartum depression, feelings of sadness and anxiety can be extreme and might interfere with a woman\u2019s ability to care for herself or her family. Because of the severity of the symptoms, postpartum depression usually requires treatment. The condition may begin shortly before or any time after childbirth, but commonly begins between a week and a month after delivery."

                "Postpartum depression probably is caused by a combination of factors. These factors include the following:\r\n\r\nChanges in hormone levels just after childbirth: levels of estrogen and progesterone decrease just after child birth and these changes may trigger depression in the same way as smaller changes in hormone levels before menstrual periods trigger mood swings and tension.\r\n\r\nHistory of depression: Women who have had depression at any time-before, during, or after pregnancy, or who currently are being treated for depression have an increased risk of developing postpartum depression.\r\n\r\nEmotional factors: If the pregnancy is not planned or is not wanted, this can affect the way a woman feels about her pregnancy and her unborn baby. Even when a pregnancy is planned, it can take a long time to adjust for having a new baby. Parents of babies who are sick or who need to stay in the hospital may feel sad, angry, or guilty. These emotions can affect a woman\u2019s self-esteem and how she deals with stress.\r\n\r\nFatigue: Many women feel very tired after giving birth. It can take weeks for a woman to regain her normal strength and energy. For women who have had their babies by cesarean section, it may take a longer time.\r\n\r\nLifestyle factors: Lack of support from family members and stressful life events, such as a recent death of a loved one, a family illness, or moving to a new city, can greatly increase the risk of postpartum depression.\r\n\r\nOther risk factors may be-\r\n\r\nFamily history of depression\r\nA difficult pregnancy or birth experience\r\nGiving birth to twins or other multiples\r\nExperiencing problems in your relationship with your partner\r\nExperiencing financial problems\r\nBeing a teen mother\r\nPreterm (before 37 weeks) labor and delivery.\r\nPregnancy with birth complications.\r\nSmoking, drinking alcohol, and use of harmful drugs\r\nNegative thoughts and feelings about being a mother, these include\r\n\r\nHaving doubts that you can be a good mother\r\nPutting pressure on yourself to be a perfect mother\r\nFeeling that you\u2019re no longer the person you were before you had your baby\r\nFeeling that you\u2019re less attractive after having your baby\r\nHaving no free time for yourself\r\nFeeling tired and moody because you aren\u2019t sleeping well or getting enough sleep"

                "Many options are there for managing PPD during pregnancy or after birth. Some women may participate in counseling (talk therapy); and others may need medication. There is no single treatment that works for everyone.\r\nTreatment can include:\r\nCounseling/Talk Therapy: \r\nWoman with PPD may have one-on-one therapy with just she and the therapist (a counselor, therapist, psychologist, psychiatrist, or social worker) or group therapy where she meets with a therapist and other people with problems similar to her.\r\nAnother option is family or couple\u2019s therapy, in which she and her family members or her partner may work with a therapist. Sometimes, therapy is needed for only a few weeks, but it may be needed for a few months or longer.\r\nCounseling can be done with two ways:\r\n\r\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps people recognize and change their negative thoughts and behaviors.\r\n\r\nInterpersonal therapy (IPT), which helps people understand and work through problematic personal relationships.\r\n\r\nSupport groups:These are groups of people who meet together or go online to share their feelings and experiences about certain topics. Counselor can suggest the support group to help.\r\nMedicine: PPD often is treated with medicine. Several medications can treat depression effectively and are safe for pregnant women and for breastfeeding mothers and their babies.\r\n\r\nAntidepressants.These are medicines used to treat many kinds of depression, including PPD. Some medicines are not safe to take during breastfeeding. Talk to your health care provider to find out about these medicines to decide which one is right for you.\r\n\r\nEstrogen.This hormone plays an important role in menstrual cycle and pregnancy. During childbirth, the amount of estrogen in the body drops quickly.\r\n\r\nIn addition to treatment following things can be advised to new mothers to manage PPD:\r\nStay healthy and fit:\r\n\r\nDo something active every day. Go for a walk or get back to the gym.\r\nEat healthy foods. These include fruits, vegetables, whole-grain breads and lean meats. Try to eat fewer sweets and salty snacks.\r\nGet as much rest as you can. Try to sleep when your baby sleeps.\r\nDon\u2019t drink alcohol. Alcohol is a depressant, and also can interact with the medicine given for PPD. You can pass alcohol to your baby through your breast milk.\r\n\r\nAsk for and accept help:\r\n\r\nBe with others: Keep in touch with people who care about you and share your feelings.\r\nMake time for yourself: Do something for you, like getting out of the house, if a family member or your partner can look after the baby.\r\nBe realistic: You don't have to do everything. You don't have to have the \"perfect\" home. Just do what you can and leave the rest.\r\nAsk for help: Don't be afraid to ask for help from family and friends, whether it's caring for the baby or doing household chores.\r\nRest when the baby rests: Sleep is just as important for you as it is for the baby. Sleep when the baby sleeps, during naps and at night.\r\nReduce your stress:\r\n\r\nDo the things that used to make you feel good about yourself before you got pregnant.\r\nDo not make any major changes in your life right after having your baby.\r\n\r\nFamily members and friends may be the first to recognize symptoms of postpartum depression in a new mother. They can encourage her to talk with a health care provider, offer emotional support, and assist with daily tasks such as caring for the baby or the home.\r\nWithout treatment, postpartum depression can last for months or years. In addition to affecting the mother\u2019s health, it can interfere with her ability to connect with and care for her baby and may cause the baby to have problems with sleeping, eating, and behavior as he or she grows."

For a human, rabies is almost always fatal if post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is not administered immediately following an exposure. The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, ultimately affecting the brain and resulting in death. The rabies virus travels to the brain through the peripheral nerves. The incubation period of the disease i.e. the time lag between the bite/exposure to rabies and onset of symptoms of the disease, is usually about a few days to few months in humans, depending on the site and severity of exposure, the  distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system and other factors .\r\nNational Rabies Control Programme\r\n\r\nNational Guidelines on Rabies Prophylaxis\r\n\r\nThe content of this module has been validated by Dr M.K.

Retinopathy of prematurity often regresses but has the potential of causing visual impairment or blindness. ROP causes disorganised growth of retinal blood vessels which may lead to retinal scarring or even detachment of retina.\r\nRetina has no blood vessels until fourth month of gestation. Thereafter, vessels emanate from hyaloid vessels at the optic disc and progress towards periphery. These vessels reach nasal periphery after eight months of gestation, but do not reach temporal periphery until about one month after delivery. Incompletely vascularised temporal part of retina is particularly susceptible to damage with oxygen therapy, particularly in premature infants. Pre-term birth affects normal retinal vascular maturation. Exposure to oxygen down-regulate retinal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), resulting in constriction/obliteration of blood vessels and delays normal retinal vascular development.\r\nSignificant ROP can lead to lifelong disability, especially in smallest survivors of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs)."

                "Retinopathy of prematurity occurs in pre-term infants born before the normal growth of retinal blood vessels. Like other retinopathies, local ischaemia of retina plays a role in ROP.\r\nExcessive oxygen exposure causes obliteration of blood vessels in immature retina. Oxygen saturation maintained at lower level from birth can reduce the rate of advancement of ROP.\r\nRisk factors for ROP:\r\n- Gestational age (32 weeks or less).\r\n- Low birth weight (Less than 1500 grams).\r\n- Extended use of supplemental oxygen.\r\n\r\nFoetus in uterus is in hypoxic state as compared to life after birth. In pre-term infants, growth of retinal vessels is stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, on exposure of immature retina to oxygen, the blood vessel constricts and can become obliterated resulting in delay of normal retinal vascular growth. This is the stage of hyperoxia-vasocessation.\r\nInitially, the retina derives oxygen by diffusion from the underlying capillary bed of choroidal layer. The retina continues to grow in thickness and outgrows its vascular supply. But over the time, avascular retina becomes ischaemic and stimulates VEGF leading to hypoxia-vasoproliferation stage and manifest as arterio-venous shunts and neovascularisation.\r\nInfants at risk are screened with appropriate timing of examination and follow up."

                "Diagnosis depends on the history of development and the clinical features.\r\nInfants with lowest birth weights and youngest gestational ages are at increased risk of ROP.\r\nProlonged exposure to supplemental oxygen is a risk factor contributing to ROP.\r\nOther predispositions with ROP are use of mechanical ventilation, patent ductus arteriosus, severity of associated illness (respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis or bronchopulmonary dysplasia).\r\nClinical features:\r\nActive ROP:\r\nThe severity of active ROP is assessed according to location, extent, stage and \u2018plus\u2019 disease.\r\nLocation: Location of ROP is determined based on three zones with optic disc being at the center.\r\n- Zone 1: It includes a circular area bounded by an imaginary circle, radius which is twice the distance from optic disc to macula.\r\n- Zone 2: It includes an area extending from edge of zone 1 to a point tangential to Ora serrata (anterior limit of retina) and round to an area near equatorial temporal retina.\r\n- Zone 3: This is the area consisting of residual temporal crescent lying anterior to zone 2.\r\nExtent: This refers to the number of clock hours affected.\r\nStages: It refers to the clinical features according to the severity of ROP.\r\n- Stage 1 (Demarcation line): The earliest sign of ROP is formation of a thin, tortuous, grey-white line running almost parallel to Ora serrata. This line is more prominent in peripheral part of temporal retina. It separates vascular posterior retina from avascular immature peripheral retina. Abnormal and branching blood vessels may form reaching up to the demarcation line.\r\n- Stage 2 (Ridge formation): Demarcation line develops into a raised ridge of tissue which represents shunt joining veins with arteries. Isolated neovascular tufts may be seen posterior to it.\r\n- Stage 3 (Ridge with extraretinal fibrovascular proliferation): There is fibrovascular proliferation over retina and into vitreous. The ridge becomes pink in colour.There is dilatation and tortuosity of the retinal blood vessels posterior to the equator. There may be retinal or vitreous haemorrhage.\r\n- Stage 4 (Partial retinal detachment): The contraction of fibrovascular tissue leads to tractional retinal detachment which starts in extreme periphery and spreads towards the center.\r\n- Stage 5 (Total retinal detachment): There is total detachment of retina.\r\n\u2018Plus disease\u2019: There is venous dilatation and tortuosity of arterioles in the posterior fundus (interior of the eyeball). When these vascular changes are present, a \u2018Plus\u2019 sign is added to the stage of disease.\r\nScreening for ROP:\r\nAll infants born at less than 36 weeks or weighing less than 1500 grams, who have received oxygen therapy, should be screened for ROP.\r\nThe most useful time for screening is between post-conceptual ages of 32 to 36 weeks. This is because retinal detachment seldom develops before that and ROP rarely appears for the first time after 36 weeks. Before post-conceptual age of 31 weeks, screening is of limited value, because it is difficult to dilate pupils and there is vitreous haze due to the presence of tunica vasculosa lentis (capillary vasculature on posterior surface of lens which disappears after birth).\r\n\r\nCicatricial ROP:\r\nFew patients with active ROP develop cicatricial complications. More advanced proliferative disease leads to more serious cicatricial sequlae. Various stages are:-\r\n- Stage 1: This shows myopia with associated retinal pigmentary disturbance and haze at the base of vitreous.\r\n- Stage 2: There is temporal vitreoretinal fibrosis with dragging of posterior retina.\r\n- Stage 3: There is more severe peripheral fibrosis with contracture and falciform (sickle shaped) retinal fold.\r\n- Stage 4: This shows partial ring of retrolental-fibrovascular tissue with partial retinal detachment.\r\n- Stage 5: There is complete ring of retrolental fibrovascular tissue with total retinal detachment. Total retinal detachment may lead to secondary angle-closure glaucoma.\r\n\r\nROP should be differentiated from:-\r\n- Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy: Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy is a genetic disorder which occurs in full term infants.\r\n- Persistent foetal vasculature: Persistent foetal vasculature, previously called persistent hyper-plastic primary vitreous (PHPV) is typically unilateral and is not related to prematurity. It can cause tractional retinal detachment."

Von Szily in the year 1900, described principal features of RCES. Paul Chandler in 1945, divided the syndrome into a macroform and a microform type, with the macroform being associated more frequently with trauma. However, later observations confirmed that the two forms may occur simultaneously and there is no sharp distinction between them.\r\nRCES may be diagnosed at almost any age and affects men and women equally. Even though the majority of patients give history of trauma, an underlying factor should be suspected when there is no history of trauma or surgery. Patients with RCES usually present with unilateral involvement, and the most commonly affected part is central part of the cornea just below the pupil. When the underlying cause is corneal dystrophy, symptoms are more often bilateral, localisation of the loosely adherent epithelium is more variable, and the management of symptoms often complicated. Trauma to the epithelium may be caused by a fingernail, plant material, sharp domestic objects, or the edge of a piece of paper. Salzmann\u2019s nodular degeneration is another common acquired disorder that may be associated with recurrent corneal erosion syndrome. Rarely, cases may occur spontaneously without any obvious predisposing factor.\r\nMost corneal erosions occur during the night or early morning hours and are described as an abrupt ripping sensation generally followed immediately by sharp pain, a marked foreign body sensation, watering, photophobia, visual disturbances, and often lid swelling. Some patients have mild symptoms every few months or years, and some experience severe, incapacitating, frequent erosions causing pain and other symptoms lasting for hours or days at a time.\r\nIn some patients with recurrent erosion, the epithelial defects never fully heal, and loose sheets of epithelium slide over the surface of the eye with each blink. These patients experience constant pain and may be some of the most distressed individuals. The unpredictable nature of recurrent erosions often heightens anxiety in patients. Patients may experience acute pain suddenly and would be unable to work or participate in normal activities for hours or days at a time.\r\nPatients may be relatively free of symptoms, except for perhaps a mild ocular foreign body sensation or vague \u2018awareness\u2019 of the affected eye between episodes of erosions. This sensation of awareness can be most noticeable in dry, cold or windy environments.\r\nIt is not uncommon for patients with severe erosions to display signs of depression and anxiety. Since most of the erosions occur during sleep or on awakening, some patients fear falling asleep and experience varying degrees of insomnia. Disruption in normal sleep patterns may exacerbate psychological stress as well as the experience of the symptoms. Anxiety may even make erosions more frequent by causing patients to open their eyes more quickly on awakening and by inducing more rapid eye movements (REMs) as well as interfering with normal blinking and tear production."

                "RCES may be associated with trauma or anterior corneal dystrophies.\r\nIn case of trauma, the initial insult causing corneal abrasion is commonly a slicing type injury, caused by a fingernail, brush, edge of a paper or even branch of a tree. The trauma to the eye is usually minor. Injuries induced by fingernails to the cornea are particularly at high risk of progressing to RCES. Old literature refers to RCES as \u2018fingernail keratitis\u2019. Injuries with fingernails, paper, or tree branches are more likely to induce RCES as compared to injuries with objects such as glass, rock or metal. Corneal trauma involving penetration into deeper stroma is less likely to induce RCES.\r\nCauses of RCES are either primary or secondary depending on whether the basement membrane complex abnormalities are intrinsic or acquired. Secondary erosive disorders encompass all the conditions except corneal dystrophies. RCES is classified as (Das et al, 2008):\r\nI Primary (Intrinsic):\r\n\r\nEpithelial basement membrane dystrophy\r\n\r\n- Cogan\u2019s micro-cystic (map-dot-fingerprint) dystrophy (most common dystrophy causing RCES).\r\n\r\nDystrophy involving Bowman\u2019s membrane\r\n\r\n- Reis- B\u03cbcklers dystrophy.\r\n- Thiel- Behnke dystrophy.\r\n\r\nStromal dystrophy\r\n\r\n- Lattice dystrophy.\r\n- Macular dystrophy.\r\nII Secondary (Acquired):\r\n\r\nDegeneration\r\n\r\n- Band shaped keratopathy.\r\n- Salzmann\u2019s nodular degeneration.\r\n\r\nTrauma     \r\n\r\n            - Traumatic epithelial abrasions.\r\n            - Chemical and thermal injury.\r\n\r\nEyelid pathology\r\n\r\n- Ectropion.\r\n- Entropion.\r\n- Floppy eyelid syndrome.\r\n- Lagophthalmos.\r\n- Meibomian gland dysfunction.\r\n- Blepharitis.\r\n\r\nFollowing ocular (eye) infection\r\n\r\n- Bacterial keratitis.\r\n- Viral keratitis.\r\n\r\nFollowing refractive surgery\r\n\r\n- Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).\r\n- Photorefractive keratectomy (RCES is rare).\r\n\r\nSystemic causes such as\r\n\r\n- Diabetes mellitus.\r\n- Epidermolysis bullosa (a mucocutaneous autoimmune disease).\r\n\r\n\r\nPathophysiology:\r\nThe pathophysiology of RCES is only partially understood. Normal adhesion of the corneal epithelium depends primarily on structures known as attachment complexes, which are composed of elements from the basal epithelial cell, basement membrane, Bowman\u2019s membrane and corneal stroma.\r\nElectron microscopic examination and immunohistochemical staining methods shows that these elements possibly include hemidesmosomes, basal lamina, lamina densa, lamina lucida, anchoring fibrils, laminin, fibronectin, and Types IV and VII collagen. Abnormalities of epithelial adhesion resulting in recurrent erosions may be associated with previous traumatic abrasions or with corneal dystrophies.\r\nFollowing injury, corneal epithelial defect is filled rapidly by epithelial cells sliding from adjacent epithelial basal layers. After this, epithelial cells begin mitosis and produce supra-basal epithelial cell layers. Sliding of basal epithelial cells can take place over either pre-existing basement membrane or bare stromal collagen. If the basement membrane remains intact after trauma, the new epithelial cell layer becomes firmly attached within a week. However, if the basement membrane is removed due to injury, some corneas appear unable to re-form normal attachment complexes, resulting in recurrent erosions occurring up to many years after the original injury."

                "Patients of RCES develop pain, watering, redness and photophobia that may vary from mild to severe. Some present with disease every day, but others have recurrences that may vary from every week or month to longer periods of time without any symptoms. Typically, pain is more severe at night or upon waking in the morning and may be related to REM during sleep or on opening of the eyelid. Patients are usually aware of this and they try to open the eyes gently every morning, but others refer that they are awakened in the middle of the night because of the pain. In acute phase of the disease, corneal erosion is always present, commonly in the lower half of the cornea, irrespective of the aetiology. This area of the cornea is in permanent contact with the tear film and lower lid and is most exposed to the evaporative dry eye disease.\r\nThe combination of a previous history of minor trauma to the involved eye, episodes of pain on awakening, and a rough irregular area of healing epithelium, is diagnostic of RCES.\r\nComparing patients following trauma with patients who had RCES secondary to epithelial basement membrane dystrophy, patients with epithelial basement membrane dystrophy were significantly more likely to be symptomatic.\r\nClinical signs: \r\nCareful slit lamp examination is needed to find the subtle signs of this syndrome, since the epithelium in many cases had already healed. The appearance of the cornea on slit lamp examination between the episodes of clinical symptoms may be normal. Sometimes, however, various degrees of epithelial or sub-epithelial oedema, located in the area of former erosion, may be seen during the asymptomatic intervals. This oedema may be subtle (minimal bedewing), discernible only with retro-illumination on slit lamp. Alternatively, a fine linear sub-epithelial opacity of fine bubbles or a distinct sub-epithelial bulla may be visible.\r\nClinical signs at slit- lamp (bio-microscopy) may show:\r\n\r\nDelicate signs of basement membrane dystrophy.\r\nSites of previous erosion.\r\nClusters of small epithelial micro-cysts.\r\nGentle pressure applied to the cornea through the eyelid may demonstrate wrinkling of loosely adherent epithelium.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, no signs are found, and then the patient is instructed to return immediately after the next episode of pain, without allowing time for the epithelium to heal and cover the erosion. This will facilitate proper diagnosis and correct location of the lesion for the purpose of treatment.\r\nFeatures of acute attack or during the first few days following the attack, in corneal epithelium: \r\n\r\nLoosely adherent and elevated epithelium.\r\nEpithelial micro-cysts.\r\nCorneal epithelial defects.\r\nStromal infiltrates and opacities may also develop at the site of the erosions.\r\nMeibomian gland dysfunction.\r\nFeatures of corneal dystrophy.\r\nTear film break up time (BUT) is often diminished on the affected areas.\r\nRetro-illumination against red reflex (with dilated pupils) shows subtle changes of erosion in corneal epithelium.\r\nFluorescein stain may be negative. Corneal erosions are stained mainly by fluorescein, whereas devitalised but intact epithelium is stained exclusively by rose bengal.\r\n\r\nThe midline below the horizontal meridian is usually the last area to re-epithelise, and the closure lines at this area are predisposed to frequent breakdown. In addition, this is the area of maximal exposure, since it opposes the line of lids closure.\r\nWhen no obvious signs of RCE are evident on the slit lamp examination, the presence of impaired epithelial adhesion is detected by:\r\nTest for epithelial adherence: Epithelial adherence may be tested with a dry cellulose sponge, which is gently rubbed over the area of suspected epithelial erosion. If the intact epithelial sheet is moveable by the sponge, then the lack of adequate epithelial-stromal adhesion is suspected. Loosely adherent epithelium folds or break down, when touched with the tip of the sponge under local anaesthesia. Explore the inferior and central cornea, but any part may be affected.\r\nCorneal topography (using computerised videokeratography): Corneal topography often reveals focal areas of corneal flattening (called corneal topographic lagoons) in eyes with RCES. This finding is important in those patients having frank symptoms but do not show epithelial abnormalities. Corneal topography may show an irregular ocular surface, which may explain visual symptoms such as diminution of vision or monocular diplopia.\r\nHistology: The ultra-structural changes associated with RCES include:\r\n\r\nAbnormal basal epithelial cell layer.\r\nProminent basal cell oedema of the epithelium.\r\nAbnormal epithelial basement membrane.\r\nSeparation of the cells from their basement membrane.\r\nAbsent or abnormal hemidesmosomes.\r\nLoss of anchoring fibrils.\r\nBinucleated cells and multinucleated giant cells have been found in the corneal epithelium. Tonofibrils, prominent in the abnormal epithelial cells, are probably responsible for forming binucleated cells.\r\nAll layers of the epithelium are infiltrated with neutrophils.\r\n\r\nConfocal microscopy: Confocal microscopy in patients with RCES associated with anterior corneal dystrophies, discloses structural changes in the basal epithelium, basement membrane, Bowman\u2019s membrane, anterior stroma, and corneal neurons.\r\nElectron microscopy: Electron microscopy shows absence of hemidesmosomes and in some cases the absence of entire thickness of basement membrane. Thinning and splitting of basement membrane may also be present. Epithelial cells may be responsible for abnormal production and attachment of the basement membrane. The presence of high number of mitochondria with abnormal shape in the basal epithelial cells, seen as intracellular vacuoles, suggests an abnormal metabolic activity.\r\n\r\nDifferential Diagnosis:\r\nRecurrent breakdown of corneal epithelium may be seen in:\r\n\r\nExposure keratopathy.\r\nNeurotrophic keratopathy with painless corneal erosions.\r\nRecurrence of herpes simplex stromal keratitis and may show an epithelial defect. Past history of dendritic corneal ulceration, gradual onset of pain and deep stromal infiltration in herpes simplex stromal keratitis distinguishes this from true recurrent corneal erosion.\r\nHard and roughened tarsal plate.\r\nForeign body under the tarsal plate.\r\nSelf- inflicted corneal injury (rare)."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nTill date, no single therapy is found to be definitive and sufficiently effective. The therapy of RCES is palliative rather than curative. The disease may be annoying, but is not vision threatening.\r\nGoals of management:\r\n\r\nPrimary goals of management: The primary goals of management of RCES during the acute attacks include pain relief and promotion of fast and prolonged epithelialisation.\r\nLong-term goals of management: Long-term goals of RCES management are stabilisation of the healed epithelium and prevention of subsequent erosion episodes.\r\n\r\nThese goals are not easily achieved, and the chronic course of resistant cases of RCES may be frustrating for both patient and physician. Typically, a stepladder approach, beginning with conservative measures and moving on to invasive intervention, is followed. Adjuvant therapy e.g. cycloplegics, offer additional relief in symptoms.\r\nOver the years, multiple treatment strategies were developed, including topical conservative treatments, such as hypertonic lubricants, soft bandage contact lenses and various aggressive surgical modalities, such as anterior stromal puncture and phototherapeutic refractive keratectomy, which aim at creating a new basement membrane-epithelial interface.\r\nTailoring the proper treatment strategy to each patient is the key to a successful control of RCES.\r\nMedical therapy:\r\nMedical therapy includes:\r\n\r\nSlow eye movements on awakening and gradual lid opening.\r\nPatching and a topical antibiotic ointment: Patching and a topical antibiotic ointment may be applied in acute episodes of RCES.\r\nTopical artificial tears (lubricants): To prevent the disease, the most widely used therapies include topical lubricants. Topical lubricants can be administered as drops, gels or ointment. The bed time application of an ointment will reduce the amount of friction between the tarsal conjunctiva and corneal epithelium overnight, during the REM, and will protect corneal epithelium from the shearing action of the eyelids upon awakening, which is the major trigger of recurrence.\r\nHyper-osmotic agents: Hyper-osmotic agents are also routinely used in RCES. During sleep there is a relative hypo-tonicity of the tear film as a result of decreased tear fluid evaporation. The reduced tear osmolarity at night will cause a shift of water from the tear film into the cornea, resulting in a relative corneal epithelial oedema and decreased epithelial adhesion. Hypertonic (5%) sodium chloride, either drops or ointment, will promote epithelial adherence by increasing the tear osmolarity, thereby, decreasing epithelial oedema and promoting epithelial adherence. These agents should be continued for few months after the last attack, as it takes a few months for the adhesion complexes to build up.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority of cases are mild and do well with these conservative treatments (topical lubricants and hyper-osmotic agents), which are effective in relieving pain and promoting initial epithelial growth. However, these modalities will not reduce the likelihood of recurrences.\r\nUseful advice for patients is to move their eyes slowly to the left and right before opening them, and to gradually retract the lower lid, to facilitate gradual separation between the tarsal conjunctiva and the corneal epithelium. This slower separation of the cornea from the tarsal conjunctiva will prevent the shearing force created on the corneal epithelium during abrupt lid opening, and will prevent the erosion.\r\nOther medical therapy includes:\r\n\r\nOsmotic colloidal solutions.\r\nTemporary soft bandage contact lenses: Temporary soft bandage contact lenses promote epithelial migration and regeneration of basement membrane by protecting the corneal epithelium from the friction by the upper tarsal conjunctiva. To be effective, a bandage contact lens should be worn for few weeks to several months replacing it every two weeks. This may enable the formation of stable adhesion complexes between the corneal epithelium and the basement membrane.\r\n\r\nThese contact lenses should be used under close medical supervision, since long-term continuous use of contact lenses may lead to bacterial keratitis and neovascularisation. However, silicone hydro-gel extended wear contact lenses, in recent years, have significantly increased the safety of long-term use of bandage contact lenses.\r\nSoft bandage contact lenses are often not effective in preventing further erosions except in cases where abnormalities in lid anatomy play a significant causative role in the erosions.\r\n\r\nAutologous serum: Autologous serum has been used effectively in RCES, significantly reducing the incidence of recurrence. It is composed of substances that are essential for epithelial healing, such as vitamin A, epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor beta, and fibronectin (FN). FN promotes epithelial cell migration and participates in the adhesion process. The lipids in the serum may act as a substitute for the lipids produced by the meibomian glands. Autologous serum is safe and no adverse effects have been reported with its use.\r\nUmbilical cord serum: Umbilical cord serum contains a higher concentration of growth factors and may be shown to be more effective in decreasing symptoms and keratoepitheliopathy in dry eyes and Sj\u00f6gren syndrome. In a small study of patients treated with artificial tears alone compared with artificial tears along with umbilical cord serum drops, there was a significant reduction in the risk of recurrence, in later group. A large amount of serum can be obtained from the umbilical cord vein at one time and as a result, many patients can benefit from one sample. Also, the lack of major histocompatibility complex (HCC) class II expression and the low expression of major HCC class I on umbilical cord tissue-derived cells may result in reduced immunogenicity. The possibility of transmission of blood-borne diseases, storage requirements, risk of allergies, and the potential risk of bacterial contamination may be problematic issues. The use of umbilical cord serum for RCES may be found to be effective in reducing the number of recurrences.\r\nTrophic growth factors (TGFs): Numerous investigational trophic growth factors (TGFs) are demonstrated to be effective in treating some patients with erosion, especially in patients with more severe types of epitheliopathy, such as those associated with long-term diabetes mellitus or neurotrophic keratopathy.\r\nTreatment of lid disease: Certain diseases like meibomian gland disease (MGD) and chronic blepharitis are associated with RCES. The tear film in MGD may have increased levels of bacterial lipases, fatty acids, interleukins and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which may interfere with corneal epithelial healing. Therefore, the usual therapeutic measures of MGD should be used in RCES as well. These include lid hygiene and oral tetracyclines. Oral tetracyclines decreases episodes of RCES by reducing free fatty acids in the tear film of MGD, by inactivating the MMPs, and by reducing the numbers of colony forming units (CFUs) from lid cultures. Low doses of tetracyclines may be continued for a few months.\r\nBotulinum toxin induced ptosis (drooping of eyelid): Botulinum toxin induced ptosis (drooping of eyelid) may be done to cover the corneal erosions in RCES resistant to simple measures.\r\nOral matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors: MMP enzymes (MMP- 2 and MMP-9), produced by corneal epithelium as well, have roles in the wound healing process, and are part of the inflammatory activity in many ocular surface disorders. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-2, may be responsible for the degradation of anchoring molecules in the adhesion complexes of the basement membrane during epithelial healing. MMP inhibitors may be used in the treatment of resistant RCES. A combination of oral doxycycline and topical steroid has been used in recalcitrant cases of RCES. The combination of topical steroids and doxycycline can inhibit the inflammatory cytokines and MMPs and promote rapid resolution, and prevent further recurrence in RCES. The use of topical steroids in the treatment of RCES must, however, be weighed against the potential risks of infection, cataract and intraocular pressure elevation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\nIn patients where consistent, aggressive medical management fails to resolve the erosions, surgical therapy may be required.\r\nIndications of surgery: \r\n\r\nAggressive medical management does not improve signs and symptoms of erosions.\r\nPatients continued pain and presence of epithelial defects, interfering with normal activities.\r\nPresence of recurring epithelial defects may result in infectious keratitis.\r\n\r\nChoice of surgical approach is determined by: \r\n\r\nFrequency and severity of erosions.\r\nPresence of concomitant dystrophy or other diseases.\r\nAetiology and location of erosions.\r\nPatients need and desires.\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy may be highly effective. Over the years, a series of surgical procedures have been described for RCES, including diamond burr polishing of Bowman\u2019s membrane, anterior stromal puncture with an insulin needle or with neodymium- doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, and excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK). As these procedures result in high success rates and carry low risks, it is advisable not to defer the surgical options if the medical therapy fails. Historically, debridement and then superficial keratectomy were the first surgical approaches to the treatment of RCES, and these procedures are still in use today.\r\n\r\nDebridement of loose epithelium: Epithelial debridement is indicated when a large area of the epithelium is loose and mobile with lid movements. Debridement of this large area of loose epithelium is necessary for pain relief, and can promote healing from the healthy adherent edges of the intact epithelium. Preoperatively, topical non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as eyedrops (bromefenac, ketorolac tromethamine or diclofenac) helps in pain management in patients for debridement. Epithelial debridement may be performed under topical anaesthesia using slit lamp, by removing the loose epithelium with a sterile sponge. Postoperatively, these drops are continued and therapeutic bandage contact lens may be prescribed if the epithelial defect is large. Topical antibiotics and cycloplegic eye drops may be required. Epithelial debridement alone cannot reduce the recurrences of epithelial erosions.\r\n\r\nThe suboptimal efficacy and limitations of this procedure derive from the fact that no significant modifications to enhance epithelial adhesions are made in Bowman\u2019s membrane or other deeper corneal structures.\r\nA technique known as alcohol delamination of the corneal epithelium has been proposed to improve the efficacy of debridement in the treatment of recurrent erosions. Debridement and removal of abnormal or reduplicated epithelium are most effective in cases where localised areas of such epithelium interfere with visual acuity by inducing refractive changes.\r\n\r\nLarge superficial epithelial keratectomy: Large superficial epithelial keratectomy is a more aggressive approach, generally requires the use of an operating microscope. This technique is much more likely to benefit patients with recurrent erosions. Like debridement, preoperative topical non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as eyedrops (bromefenac, ketorolac tromethamine or diclofenac) helps in pain management in patients for superficial epithelial keratectomy procedures. Postoperatively, these drops are continued and therapeutic bandage contact lens may be prescribed.\r\n\r\nThe optimum candidate for this procedure is one having:\r\n- Spontaneous multiple erosions in different areas of cornea.\r\n- No history of trauma.\r\n- Severe basement dystrophy, resulting in poor vision.\r\n- Large areas of loosely adherent irregular epithelium.\r\n\r\nAnterior stromal puncture using needle: Anterior stromal puncture is a highly effective and widely used technique, involving the use of a needle to make multiple shallow penetrations through the epithelium into anterior corneal stroma, thus, improving epithelial adhesion. When discussing with patients, the term epithelial reinforcement may be substituted for stromal puncture to allay patient anxiety. Epithelial reinforcement may be performed either between erosive episodes or through loose, irregular epithelium during an active erosive phase without the need for debridement. This procedure incites reactive fibrosis/ scarring, and production of extra cellular matrix proteins that are responsible for proper adhesion of the epithelium to its substrate. The procedure is performed under topical anaesthesia. Preoperative NSAIDS (ketorolac or diclofenac) and antibiotic cover (fluoroquinolone or other antibiotic) is given for management of pain and infection, respectively. Fluorescein sodium may be instilled topically before the treatment to define the affected area. Perpendicular multiple superficial punctures are placed about 0.5mm apart in the affected area. Treatment is extended to 1-2 mm into the normal epithelium bordering the lesion, because the loose epithelium usually extends beyond the visible limits of the erosion. Treatment within the pupil area should be minimised, if possible. Since anterior stromal puncture may result in sub epithelial scars, its use is not advisable if the erosion directly involves the visual axis, since a central scar may result in glare and a reduction in visual acuity. Immediately after the treatment, a bandage contact lens is placed and antibiotics are given for about one week.\r\n\r\nOnce re-epithelialisation has occurred, hyper-osmotic ointments are used to lubricate and protect the delicate healed epithelial tissue.\r\nFailure of anterior stromal puncture treatment in few patients is due to small treatment area, and erosions then develop outside of the treated area. A second, larger treatment can often resolve erosions in patients in whom the initial procedure is unsuccessful.\r\nAnterior stromal puncture has also been tried/ used in patients with corneal erosions associated with bullous keratopathy. Although corneal stromal oedema is generally well tolerated, rupture of epithelial bullae and the resulting corneal erosions in these patients can be very painful. For some of these bullous keratopathy patients with erosions, who are poor candidates for penetrating keratoplasty because of poor visual potential or medical contraindications, anterior stromal puncture has been shown to be a useful treatment. Anterior stromal puncture can also be used to control painful erosions in patients with bullous keratopathy who are awaiting corneal transplantation. The optimum patients for this type of treatment are those whose bullae are localised and not diffusely distributed throughout the cornea.\r\n\r\nAnterior stromal puncture using neodymium- doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser: Anterior stromal puncture may also be performed with a short-pulsed Nd:YAG laser. The advantage of laser puncture over needle puncture is that the laser puncture is more reproducible, shallow, and translucent.\r\nNeodymium- doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser keratectomy.\r\nMicrodiathermy.\r\nExcimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Partial ablation of Bowman\u2019s layer, with excimer laser PTK, provides smooth bed for migrating epithelium, and results in new hemidesmosomal adhesion complexes. The basal epithelial layer forms hemidesmosomes and new basement membrane within two weeks of laser photo-ablation. Thus, new hemidesmosomes, anchoring fibrils, and epithelial basement membrane are synthesised rapidly and in increasing amounts after PTK. In addition, removing the basement membrane allows the epithelium to come into direct contact with stromal elements, stimulating the synthesis of new anchoring fibrils and hemidesmosomes.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to remove a 6.0-mm diameter of thick anterior stromal layer. The eye is patched after putting cycloplegic and antibiotic drops. Bandage contact lens may be required during the postoperative period.\r\nPTK results in a higher rate of success for RCES following trauma than corneal dystrophies.\r\n Advantages of PTK are:\r\n- Removal of corneal tissue with extreme precision.\r\n- Precision helps in preventing damage to the non-ablated area.\r\n- Simultaneous treatment of wider areas.\r\n Disadvantages of PTK are:\r\n- Postoperative discomfort.\r\n- Hypermetropic (hyperopic) shift is caused by the central flattening of the cornea. More advanced PTK, based on flying spot beam profiles, is associated with fewer undesirable refractive changes, compared to those with older, broader beam lasers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiamond burr superficial keratectomy (DBSK): Epithelial debridement and diamond burr polishing of Bowman\u2019s membrane is another, less commonly used option in the treatment of RCES. This procedure includes the debridement of loose sheets of epithelium from the cornea using a combination of peeling with forceps and gentle wiping with a cellulose sponge. If the erosion is within the visual axis, the entire corneal surface is polished with a fine diamond burr. The limbal epithelium is left intact in 1-2 mm circumferential periphery. Treatment is limited to the anterior part of Bowman\u2019s layer. A bandage contact lens is applied and antibiotics are given following treatment.\r\n\r\n Advantages of diamond burr polishing are:\r\n- The results of diamond burr polishing are comparable to those of PTK.\r\n- A subtle granular sub-epithelial deposit is initially noticed which clears in about three months postoperatively. A study on RCES and anterior basement membrane dystrophy showed significantly less haze after diamond burr polishing as compared to PTK.\r\n- Diamond burr polishing is a simple, less expensive procedure with fewer recurrences as compared to PTK.\r\n- Diamond burr polishing can be used to treat RCES involving the visual axis.\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\n\r\nOverall, the prognosis is very good to excellent with proper care. Unless there is an ongoing underlying corneal disease, most patients ultimately have healed cornea and do not have any more episodes. However, the healing process itself may take many years.\r\nWhile most patients respond well to conservative medical therapy, surgical means in the form of epithelial debridement, anterior stromal puncture, excimer laser PTK, or diamond burr polishing of the Bowman\u2019s membrane have excellent success rates. As these procedures result in high success rates and carry low risks, it is advisable not to defer the surgical options if the medical therapy fails."

                "Rheumatic fever (RF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) are major public health problems among children and young adults in developing countries; though RF/RHD has declined in developed countries. Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is an illness caused by an immunological reaction to infection with the bacterium group A streptococcus (GAS). RF affects connective tissues, and may result in rheumatic heart disease which may progress to heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and embolic stroke.\r\nRF and RHD are nonsuppurative complications of Group A streptococcal pharyngitis (sore throat) due to a delayed immune response. Group A streptococcal infection is endemic throughout the world, but epidemics are common, particularly among schoolchildren, in residential facilities for the elderly, and in other unique populations such as military personnel. ARF, considered as a classical disease of poverty, commonly appears in children between the ages of 5 and 15 years in developing countries. It occurs 1\u20133 weeks after an untreated GAS pharyngitis and is an inflammatory disease, with marked tendency to recur.\r\nThe consequences of RF and RHD include continuing damage to the heart, increasing disability, repeated hospitalization, and premature death.\r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) in 2005 estimated that there are about 15.6 million cases of RHD world-wide. A vast majority of cases are in developing countries. About 2, 82,000 new cases of RHD and over 4, 70,000 new cases of RF occur every year, and 2, 33,000 people die due to RHD each year.\r\nIn India population based study indicates prevalence of RHD to be about 2/1000 population, however survey conducted in school children in the age group of 5-16 years by ICMR gives overall prevalence of 6/1000(range 1.8 to 11/1000).\r\nRheumatic fever is endemic in India and remains one of the major causes of cardiovascular disease, accounting for nearly 25-45% of the acquired heart disease.\r\nThe burden of ARF in industrialized countries declined dramatically during the 20th century, due to improved living conditions and increased hygiene standards, along with better access to appropriate health services and increased access to penicillin-based medications. In many developing countries, lack of awareness of these measures, coupled with shortages of money and resources, are important barriers to the control of the disease.\r\nEarly treatment of streptococcal sore throat can prevent the development of rheumatic fever. Regular long term penicillin treatment can prevent rheumatic fever becoming rheumatic heart disease, and can halt disease progression in people whose heart valves are already damaged by the disease. RF/RHD is a neglected public health problem in India. If treated, 75% of people with rheumatic fever recover completely. RHD is one of the preventable chronic disorders of heart."

Special tests such as culture of the throat are needed for laboratory confirmation. If group A Streptococcal pharyngitis is not treated then some children can get affected by Rheumatic fever (RF).\r\nIn RF typically, the child may complain of fever, accompanied by following symptoms-\r\nArthritis- Pain and swelling of joints is the common symptom of the ARF, occurring in up to 75% of patients in the first attack of RF. Larger joints such as knees, ankles, elbows and wrists on both sides of body are usually affected. There is sequential involvement of joints, with each completing a cycle of inflammation and resolution. There is excruciating pain on touch. Symptoms of arthritis pass within four to six weeks without causing any permanent damage.\r\nCarditis (inflammation of heart) occurs in an estimated 30-60% of people with rheumatic fever. Symptoms may be seen in the form of shortness of breath, persistent cough, rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), chest pain, and feeling of tiredness all the time.\r\nSubcutaneous nodules- Round, firm, freely movable, painless nodules varying in size from 0.5\u20132.0cm are found over bony prominences or extensor tendons.\r\nRheumatic chorea- About 1 in four children with rheumatic fever can develop involuntary and uncontrolled jerking and twitching of the body, mostly hands and feet, difficulty in performing task requiring fine hand movements such as writing, problem with balance, unusual emotional outbursts, such as crying or laughing for no apparent reason. These symptoms pass within few months.\r\nSkin rash- About one in ten children of rheumatic fever skin rash develops known as erythema marginatum. The rash is painless, non-itchy and subsides usually within few weeks or months.\r\nLess common symptoms of ARF include high temperature, abdominal pain, bleeding nose."

                "Rheumatic fever is caused by the immune system overreacting to the presence of group A streptococcus bacteria. During infection theimmune systemfights the infection by producing antibodies to proteins on the surface of the bacteria. In certain strains of group A streptococcal bacteria, the proteins on the bacteria appear similar to proteins in the human cells and the immune system begins to attack human cells with similar proteins such as heart, joints, skin. \r\nRF and RHD are epidemiologically associated with Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis. Streptococci are a large group of gram-positive, nonmotile, non\u2013spore-forming cocci about 0.5-1.2 \u00b5m in size.\r\nStreptococcus pyogenes causes a wide variety of diseases in humans. It is one of the most common causes of acute bacterial pharyngitis that leads to RF/RHD. Impetigo, a common skin infection, is also caused by S. pyogenes and is associated with acute glomerulonephritis (AGN). In rare cases, S. pyogenes causes invasive diseases such as cellulitis, bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, and toxic shock syndrome (TSS).\r\nThe risk of an attack of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) following GAS pharyngitis has been reported to be 0.3% under endemic conditions to 3% during epidemic conditions. During the winter and spring seasons in temperate climates, up to 20% of the school-aged children may be GAS carriers. The commonest age group involved is 5-15 years with no sex predisposition.\r\nRF is linked to overcrowding in poor housing conditions (due to increased GAS infection). It declines sharply when the standard of living improves."

Diagnosis is based on clinical assessment and the identification of a number of signs and symptoms that are associated with the illness. Signs and symptoms of ARF are divided into two categories: major and minor.\r\nMajor signs and symptoms are strongly associated with ARF and include carditis (swelling of the heart), arthritis (pain, redness and swelling of one or more joints), Sydenham\u2019s chorea (strange movements of the body and face), erythema marginatum (painless skin pigmentation), and subcutaneous nodules (small lumps under the skin).\r\nMinor signs and symptoms are used to help support the diagnosis. These include fever, arthralgia (generalised joint aches), blood tests that suggest general illness (elevated ESR), and changes seen on electrocardiogram (Increased P-R interval).\r\nJones criteria for the diagnosis of rheumatic fever-The Jones criteria were introduced in 1944 as a set of clinical guidelines for the diagnosis of rheumatic fever (RF). According to revised Jones criteria, the diagnosis of RF can be made when two of the major criteria or one major criterion plus two minor criteria, are present along with evidence of Streptococcal infection (Streptococcal serum antibody tests).\r\nRheumatic heart disease (RHD) is most accurately diagnosed using ultrasound. Ultrasound of the heart is referred to as echocardiography."

                "Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome or Herpes zoster oticus is a syndrome characterised by acute otalgia, herpetic vesicular rash associated with facial palsy. This is the second most common cause of facial paralysis and is due to reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that remains dormant/latent in the geniculate ganglion after primary infection with chickenpox. Characteristic presentation is severe acute otalgia with unilateral facial paralysis. Vesicular eruptions if not present initially, may appear usually within three to five days. The vesicles may appear on post-auricular skin, pinna, concha, ear canal, and tympanic membrane. Occasionally it may affect neck, shoulder or oral cavity. Besides facial nerve, it may affect other cranial nerves as well.\r\nRamsay-Hunt in 1907 first described Herpes zoster oticus in a patient with otalgia associated with cutaneous and mucosal rashes, which was ascribed to geniculate ganglion infection with varicella zoster virus (human herpes virus type 3). This syndrome is also known by the names geniculate neuralgia or nervus intermedius neuralgia.\r\nAs compared to Bell\u2019s palsy, the symptoms are more severe and carries worse prognosis in Ramsay Hunt syndrome. The risk and frequency of complete facial nerve degeneration is substantially higher than the Bell\u2019s palsy. Patients with vestibular and auditory dysfunction in addition to facial paralysis generally also have worse prognosis. Patients with diabetes, hypertension and advanced age have poorer prognosis.\r\nBilateral Ramsay Hunt syndrome has also been reported in diabetic patients or immunocompromised patients.\r\nOther cranial nerve neuropathies e.g. neuropathy of V,VI,VIII,IX, and X, may be associated with Ramsay Hunt syndrome."

Erythematous macules/papules develop around ear (commonly affecting concha or external auditory canal). Soon it turns into vesicles which may ulcerate.\r\nThe clinical presentation varies in severity from case to case. General features include periauricular pain, herpetiform eruptions and neural dysfunction, involving VII and VIII cranial nerve predominantly.\r\n\r\nHistology:\r\nThere is swelling and inflammation of the ganglion of affected cranial nerve with VZV. Inflammation is predominantly lymphocytic in nature. Some cells of the ganglion show swelling and others may be degenerated.\r\n\r\nInvestigations:\r\n\r\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Magnetic Resonance Imaging shows enhancement of a large portion of facial nerve. Often the vestibular and cochlear nerve, labyrinth, and dura lining internal auditory canal may also show enhancement.\r\nBrainstem auditory evoked response: Brainstem auditory evoked response shows significant increase in latencies of certain waves, and also inter-peak latencies in others.\r\n\r\nSaliva: VZV DNA level in saliva helps to understand viral reactivation in facial nerve and oropharyngeal epithelium.\r\nCerebrospinal fluid: Real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of CSF may be done to diagnose this virus.\r\n\r\nRoutine imaging is unnecessary. Even electro-diagnostic studies are unreliable in Ramsay Hunt syndrome.\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis\r\nPrimary initial differentiation is between facial neuropathy and a diagnosis of stroke. Once it is ascertained that the diagnosis is not stroke, than the differentiation is between Bell\u2019s palsy and secondary causes of facial neuropathy. Bell\u2019s palsy accounts for up to 70% of facial neuropathies. Clue to secondary causes include involvement of other cranial nerves or neurologic diseases. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is the second most common cause. The external auditory canal, mouth and tongue should be examined for vesicles to distinguish this condition from Bell\u2019s palsy.\r\nOther conditions to be distinguished are\r\n\r\nLyme disease\r\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome\r\nMeningitis\r\nHIV infection."

Most cases develop in children and young people who are between the ages of 5 and 20, making it the third most common cancer in young people (afterleukemiaand brain tumors). Osteosarcoma usually develops in the larger bones, such as the thigh bone (femur) or the shin bone (tibia).\r\nEwing's sarcoma:Ewing's sarcoma usually develops inpelvis, thigh bone or shin bone and mostcommonlyoccurs inchildren and young people aged between 10 and 20 years.\r\nChondrosarcoma:This type of bone cancer usually develops in adults who are between the ages of 40 and 50. The most common sites for chondrosarcoma to develop are pelvis, thigh bone, upper arm bone, shoulder blade (scapula) and the ribs.\r\nCordoma: The majority of cordoma arise in the sacrum, base of the skull and spines, but it affects older adults aged 40 or over."

If somebody else comes into close contact with the sore, typically during sexual contact, they can also become infected. The sore lasts two to six weeks before disappearing.\r\nStage 2 (Secondary syphilis) \u2013 Secondary symptoms, such as a skin rash and sore throat develop. These symptoms may disappear within a few weeks, after which person may experience a latent (hidden) phase with no symptoms, which can last for years. After this, syphilis can progress to its third, most dangerous stage.\r\nStage 3 (Tertiary syphilis) \u2013 Around a third of people who are not treated for syphilis will develop tertiary syphilis.

Also symptoms are mild and thus can be difficult to recognize.\r\nThe symptoms develop in three stages:\r\n\r\nPrimary syphilis\r\nSecondary syphilis\r\nTertiary syphilis\r\n\r\nPrimary syphilis\r\nThe initial symptoms of syphilis can appear any time from 10 days to three months after one have been exposed to the infection.\r\nThe most common symptom is the appearance of a small, painless sore or ulcer (calledchancre). The sore will appear on the part of body where the infection was transmitted, typically the penis, vagina, anus, rectum, tongue or lips. Most people only have one sore, but some people can have more.\r\nThe sores are painless and may be overlooked, so the condition can be spread without realizing that have an infection.\r\nThe sore will then disappear within two to six weeks and, if the condition is not treated, syphilis will move into its second stage.\r\nSecondary syphilis\r\nThe symptoms of secondary syphilis will begin a few weeks after the disappearance of the sore.\r\nCommon symptoms include:\r\n\r\nA non-itchy skin rash appearing anywhere on the body, but commonly on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet\r\nTiredness\r\nHeadaches\r\nSwollen lymph glands\r\n\r\nLess common symptoms include:\r\n\r\nFever\r\nWeight loss\r\nPatchy hair loss\r\nJoint pains\r\n\r\nThese symptoms may disappear within a few weeks, or come and go over a period of months.\r\nLatent phase\r\nSyphilis will then move into its latent (hidden) phase, where one will experience no symptoms, even though person remains infected. Latent syphilis can still be passed on during the first year of this stage of the condition, usually through sexual or close physical contact. However, after a couple of years, one cannot pass the infection to others, even though he/she remain infected.\r\nThe latent stage can continue for many years (even decades) after person has first become infected.\r\nWithout treatment, there is a risk that latent syphilis will move on to the most dangerous stage \u2013 tertiary syphilis.\r\nTertiary syphilis\r\nThe symptoms of tertiary syphilis can begin years or even decades after initial infection. Around a third of people who are not treated for syphilis develop serious symptoms at this stage.\r\nThe symptoms of tertiary syphilis will depend on what part of the body the infection spreads to. For example, it may affect the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, bones, skin or blood vessels, potentially causing any of the following symptoms:\r\n\r\nStroke\r\nDementia\r\nLoss of co-ordination\r\nNumbness\r\nParalysis\r\nBlindness\r\nDeafness\r\nHeart disease\r\nSkin rashes\r\nAt this stage, syphilis can be dangerous enough to cause death."

                "Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK) is relatively an uncommon chronic disease of superior limbus/cornea, and superior bulbar and tarsal conjunctiva. It affects one or both eyes of middle-aged people, about half the patients have abnormal thyroid function (usually hyperthyroidism). About three percent of patients with thyroid eye disease develop SLK. Women are more commonly affected than men.\r\nSuperior limbic keratoconjunctivitis is believed to be due to blink-related trauma between the upper lid and the superior bulbar conjunctiva, precipitated in many cases by tear film insufficiency, and an excess of lax conjunctival tissue. With increased conjunctival movement, there is mechanical damage to the tarsal and bulbar conjunctival surfaces. It results in inflammatory response, leading to increased conjunctival oedema and redundancy, with the creation of a self-perpetuating cycle. It may be analogous to conjunctivochalasis (redundant excess fold of conjunctiva) affecting the lower bulbar conjunctiva.\r\nSuperior limbic keratoconjunctivitis has similarities to mechanically induced papillary conjunctivitis and a comparable clinical picture may be seen in:\r\n\r\nContact lens wearers.\r\nTrauma to upper lid.\r\nUpper eyelid surgery.\r\n\r\nBetween 1954 and 1963, reports by Braley and Alexander (Braley AE, Alexander RC. Superficial punctate keratitis. Arch Ophthalmol, 1953; 50(2):147-154), Thygesson and Kimura (Thygesson P, Kimura SJ: Chronic conjunctivitis. Trans Am Acad Ophthalmol Otolaryngol 1963; 67: 494-517) presented information about a new clinical entity associated with filamentary keratopathy.\r\nSuperior limbic keratoconjunctivitis was first fully described by Frederick Theodore in 1963. (Theodore FH. Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis. Eye Ear Nose Throat Mon 1963; 42: 25-28.). He suggested the term Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis to describe a series of patients with the following presenting signs:\r\n\r\nInflammation of the superior tarsal conjunctiva,\r\nInflammation of the superior bulbar conjunctiva,\r\nFine punctate staining of the superior cornea, limbus, and the adjacent conjunctiva, and\r\nFilaments on the superior limbus or upper fourth of the cornea.\r\n\r\nSLK is probably under-diagnosed because symptoms are typically more severe than signs. The course can be prolonged over years although remission eventually occurs spontaneously."

                "Soft contact lens wear may be associated with features like SLK. It may be attributable to preservatives especially thiomersal. Removal of lens or preservatives is usually curative.\r\nThere have been many theories about the aetiology of SLK, but still some uncertainty remains till date.\r\nPossible aetiological theories:\r\nMechanical trauma:\r\nMechanical trauma is the most popularly assumed theory as aetiology of SLK.\r\nThere is constant abnormal movement of the superior bulbar conjunctiva during blinking due to abnormal interaction of the superior tarsal and bulbar conjunctiva. The laxity of bulbar conjunctiva because of congenital origin or due to ageing, predisposes it to get repeatedly traumatised by upper lid as the lid is opened or closed. This abnormality may be due to tight apposition of tarsal conjunctiva against the globe in the setting of:\r\n\r\nThyroid eye disease e.g. endocrine exophthalmos (Some believe that when thyroid exophthalmos leads to SLK, it is of mechanical aetiology, since SLK disappears on control of endocrine exophthalmos. The upper eyelid is tensely applied against the upper bulbar conjunctiva and cornea because of thyroid abnormality,\r\nScarring of the superior tarsal conjunctiva,\r\nInflammation (Patients with chronic ocular inflammatory disease can develop a picture of SLK because of increased friction between the superior palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva. The chronically inflamed palpebral conjunctival surface could lead to a change in viscosity that prevents the normal maturation and replacement of bulbar conjunctival epithelium), or\r\nDryness of the eyes (patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca may have a drying effect between upper lid and bulbar conjunctiva and it increases the friction between the two).\r\n\r\nThis theory is supported by strong association of SLK with both thyroid dysfunction and dry eye disease.\r\nThere is high expression of transforming growth factor-beta 2 and tenascin, both are known to be affected by mechanical stress and injury.\r\nThe mechanical irritation induces abnormal mucous production and this abnormal mucous production is responsible for filament formation.\r\nBiochemical abnormalities:\r\nAlteration in expression of certain cytokeratins (CKs) is found in patients with SLK. There is decreased expression of a marker for non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelium, CK13 along with increased expression of CK10, a marker for keratinisation, which correlates with disease severity. These suggest that an abnormality of differentiation in conjunctival epithelium plays a role in the disease.\r\nViral aetiology:\r\nSome have suggested a viral cause, but cultures are found to be universally negative.\r\nBacterial aetiology:\r\nIn some studies, bacterial cultures have been shown to be positive, but mostly for normal ocular flora.\r\nAutoimmune aetiology:\r\nAn autoimmune aetiology has also been proposed but this is also less likely due to:\r\n\r\nThe lack of immunoglobulin deposition (seen on direct immune-fluorescence),\r\nLack of increase in eosinophils, and\r\nVariable response to topical steroids.\r\n\r\nHyperparathyroidism has also been reported in association with SLK.\r\nA familial association has rarely been reported but is not the norm."

                "History of contact lens wear, and previous eyelid surgery or trauma should be obtained from the patient.\r\nEven in untreated patients, the natural course of disease is one of episodic intermittent relapses and gradual improvement over several years, with eventual resolution. Most patients have bilateral affection, but asymmetric and unilateral disease does occur. The disease is roughly twice more common in females. It typically presents in fourth or fifth decades of life.\r\nPatients with SLK present with non-specific ocular complaints. Symptoms are usually much more severe if the patient has corneal filaments. Often irritation is mild in the morning but it worsens thereafter. The symptoms can be vague and intermittent and often are mistaken for other ocular surface disease, such as dry eye or blepharitis. SLK patients are often misdiagnosed or are not diagnosed for many years, because superior conjunctiva is frequently not examined or clinical findings are often missed.\r\nA diagnosis of SLK should only be made after a thorough patient history is obtained and physical examination is performed, since diagnosis is based primarily on the clinical findings.\r\nClinical examination:\r\nIt requires slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) examination by an eye-specialist.\r\nConjunctiva/Limbus:\r\nIt is advisable in suspected SLK patient to simultaneously elevate both upper lids and look at the superior conjunctiva. \r\n\r\n\r\nConjunctival injection: Conjunctival injection is best examined with un-aided eye. The classical finding associated with SLK is superior bulbar conjunctival injection. The superior bulbar and limbal conjunctiva shows sectoral congestion in the form of radial band. Vital stains, such as rose Bengal or lissamine green are the most effective way to highlight abnormal conjunctiva. These stains are especially useful in cases where the conjunctival injection may be subtle. It is important to note that vital staining of the superior bulbar conjunctiva does not guarantee a diagnosis of SLK.\r\nLimbal papillary hypertrophy: There may be limbal papillary hypertrophy.\r\nLoss of superior limbal palisades: Normally present limbal palisades of Vogt may be lost superiorly.\r\nRedundancy of the superior bulbar conjunctiva: Light downward pressure on the upper lid results in a fold of redundant conjunctiva crossing the upper limbus.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thickening and hyperaemia of bulbar conjunctiva extends from upper limbus towards the insertion of the superior rectus muscle.\r\n\r\nSuperior conjunctival filaments.\r\nPapillary reaction on superior tarsal conjunctiva: The papillae on superior tarsal conjunctiva are fine, small and numerous and often have a diffuse velvety appearance.\r\nPetechial haemorrhages: Petechial haemorrhages may be present.\r\nKeratinisation: Keratinisation may be demonstrated on biopsy or impression cytology of conjunctiva.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inferior tarsal conjunctiva is typically normal.\r\n\r\nCornea:\r\n\r\nPunctate epithelial keratitis: The superior cornea is involved in one-fourth to one-third cases and shows fine epithelial staining as punctate epithelial keratitis with fluorescein sodium or rose Bengal dye. Lesions of punctate epithelial keratitis are often separated from the limbus by a zone of normal epithelium.\r\nMicropannus: Mild superior micropannus (superficial fibrovascular proliferation that extends 1-2 mm beyond normal vascular arcade) may be present in patients with long-standing disease.\r\nSuperior corneal filaments: The presence of filaments on the superior cornea should alert to the diagnosis of SLK, as this is the most common cause of the finding.\r\nCorneal hypoesthesia: Corneal hypoesthesia is also sometimes present.\r\nKeratoconjunctivitis sicca: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca may be present in about half the cases of SLK.\r\n\r\nPseudoptosis: \r\n\r\nInflammatory pseudoptosis: Inflammatory pseudoptosis (drooping of upper eyelid) may be seen in advanced cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey to the diagnosis: \r\nKey to the diagnosis of SLK is the examination of superior bulbar conjunctiva by:\r\n\r\nElevation of upper lid: Elevate upper lid to examine superior bulbar conjunctiva. It is prudent to include lid elevation as part of the eye examination. The diagnosis of SLK is missed if the upper lid is not elevated.\r\nAssessment of superior bulbar conjunctival injection: Superior bulbar conjunctival injection may be subtle. Subtle findings may go unrecognised, if superior conjunctiva is examined with the bio-microscope on high magnification only.\r\n\r\nHistopathology:\r\nBiopsy of superior bulbar conjunctiva generally shows keratinised epithelium as well as cellular infiltration (polymorphonuclear leukocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). Along with this, it shows acanthosis, dyskeratosis and balloon degeneration of some nuclei. The demonstration of these features on diagnostic scrapings of the superior bulbar conjunctiva stained with Giemsa, helps in diagnosis of doubtful cases.\r\nElectron microscopy shows abnormal distribution and aggregation of nuclear chromatin, filaments in nuclei, dense accumulations of cytoplasmic filaments that surround nuclei, and formation of multi-lobed nuclei or multi-nucleated inflammatory cells.\r\nPalpebral conjunctiva is normal but polymorphonuclear cells are often present.\r\nWright (Wright P: Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis. Trans Ophthalmol Soc UK 92: 555, 1972) has stressed on the goblet cell population in SLK. Superior palpebral conjunctiva shows goblet cell hypertrophy, while bulbar conjunctiva which is thickened and keratinised shows very few goblet cells.\r\nDiagnostic procedures:\r\n\r\nTest for redundancy of the superior bulbar conjunctiva: The redundancy of the superior bulbar conjunctiva can be demonstrated by using a cotton-tipped applicator to pull the conjunctiva down over the superior cornea, under local anaesthesia. This is not possible with normal conjunctiva.\r\nImpression cytology: Impressions of superior bulbar conjunctiva show severe squamous metaplasia, with a relative absence of goblet cells. Impressions of the superior tarsal conjunctiva show mild squamous metaplasia with inflammatory cells, while impressions of the inferior tarsal conjunctiva are essentially normal. Impression cytology aid in diagnosis, but is rarely necessary.\r\nConfocal microscopy: Confocal microscopy is used as an adjunctive diagnostic tool when SLK is suspected clinically. Two variables studied were mean individual epithelial cell area (MIECA) and nucleocytoplasmic (N/C) ratio. As compared to normal controls, SLK patients showed a significantly increased MIECA and a decreased N/C ratio. In addition, inflammatory cell density in SLK patients was increased, compared to controls.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuperior limbic keratoconjunctivitis should be differentiated from the conditions such as:\r\n\r\nContact lens wearers: It is believed that contact lens preservative thiomersal exposure is responsible for contact lens induced changes like SLK. Only a small percentage of contact lens wearer shows keratinisation and filaments and a good number of patients had decreased vision and had more diffuse inflammation of the bulbar conjunctiva than is seen with SLK. The punctate epithelial keratitis is also more than what is observed in SLK. Contact lens-related change soon disappears with the cessation of their usage. SLK has got a very chronic course with periods of remissions and recurrences.\r\nAllergic conjunctivitis.\r\nKeratoconjunctivitis sicca.\r\nEpidemic keratoconjunctivitis.\r\nTrachoma.\r\nDysthyroid ophthalmopathy.\r\nEpiscleritis.\r\nFloppy eyelid syndrome.\r\nViral conjunctivitis."

It reduces friction between the tarsal and bulbar conjunctiva.\r\nAcetylcysteine: Acetylcysteine breaks down filaments and provide lubrication to the ocular surface.\r\nRebamipide: Rebamipide, a mucin-inducing and secretion-promotive eye drop has shown promising results.\r\nAutologous serum tears: Autologous serum tears may be more beneficial than artificial tears, providing objective and subjective improvement, but it requires more frequent instillation during the day.\r\nTopical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroids may produce symptomatic improvement in some cases, but the overall results have been variable. Corticosteroids may be best used in short intensive courses with rapid tapering, and should be reserved for severe cases.\r\nTopical cyclosporine A: Topical cyclosporine A, an immune-modulator, may have very good success with resolution of symptoms in patients. It may be used as primary or adjunctive therapy, particularly in the presence of co-existing keratoconjunctivitis sicca. However, maintenance therapy is required for continued benefit.\r\nRetinoic acid: Retinoic acid retards keratinisation.\r\nTopical mast cell stabilisers: Topical mast cell stabilisers inhibit type I immediate hypersensitivity reactions and are used for long-term inhibition of inflammation (e.g. lodoxamide tromethamine and sodium cromoglycate).\r\nTopical ketotifen fumarate: Topical ketotifen fumarate , a mast cell stabiliser and selective H1-blocking antihistamine (dual acting drug), addresses any inflammatory component and help in resolution of symptoms; but objective signs do not always improve.\r\nTopical vitamin A: Topical vitamin A also helps in resolution of symptoms.\r\nSupra-tarsal triamcinolone injection: When topical treatment is unsuccessful, injection of medication may break the inflammatory cycle. Supra-tarsal triamcinolone injection decrease symptoms and corneal/ conjunctival staining.\r\nLarge-diameter contact lenses: Chun and Kim used large-diameter contact lenses to decrease trauma to the superior bulbar conjunctiva, and hence, improved symptoms.

Different methods have been employed to attempt to tighten the redundant superior bulbar conjunctiva.\r\nTightening procedures for redundant superior bulbar conjunctiva:\r\n\r\nSilver nitrate: Initial attempts with silver nitrate were effective, but severe ocular burns may result, especially when using a solid applicator. Silver nitrate application usually results in relief of symptoms for 4 to 6 weeks. Any residual remnant of silver nitrate is irrigated after a minute. It may be reapplied in cases with recurrence of disease.\r\nCryotherapy: Liquid nitrogen cryotherapy as a single application or repeated for recalcitrant cases is a safe and effective therapy, using the double freeze-thaw technique under topical anaesthesia.\r\nThermocautery: Use of thermocautery to tighten the superior bulbar conjunctiva may result in resolution of symptoms with increase in density of goblet cells.\r\nConjunctival fixation sutures: Conjunctival fixation sutures placed in superior fornix, results in complete resolution of symptoms as well.\r\n\r\nResection of the superior bulbar conjunctiva: Resection of the superior bulbar conjunctiva is used in cases where medical treatment and/or conjunctival tightening are not successful. This technique has been most successful, predictable and usually gives immediate as well as permanent relief of symptoms. This is the preferred and initial surgical treatment. Conjunctival resection alleviates symptoms and results in resolution of squamous metaplasia of conjunctiva. In rare cases, redundant conjunctiva can recur, necessitating further conjunctival resection or application of silver nitrate.\r\nTemporary superior and/or inferior punctal occlusion: Temporary superior and/or inferior punctal occlusion may be done for concomitant lacrimal insufficiency, and it may be combined with instillation of artificial tears.\r\nManagement of associated thyroid dysfunction may improve SLK.\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nIn general, prognosis for superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis is excellent. With increasing age, exacerbations tend to diminish in frequency with eventual total resolution, though symptoms may last for years."

When a person cannot swallow properly, there is a risk that food and drink may get into the windpipe and then into the lungs (called aspiration), which can lead to chest infections and pneumonia.\r\nCertain other tests carried out generally to diagnose stroke are as follows: Ultrasound (carotid ultrasonography)\r\nAn ultrasound scan uses high frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of the body. Doctor may use a wand-like probe (transducer) to send high-frequency sound waves into neck. These pass through the tissue, creating images on a screen that will show if there is any narrowing or clotting in the arteries leading to brain.\r\nThis type of ultrasound scan is sometimes also known as a \"Doppler Scan\" or a \"Duplex Scan\".\r\nBrain Angiography\r\nThis is done to take images of the blood vessels of the brain. This can be done using CT (CT angiography), MRA (MR angiography) or injecting dye called catheter angiography.\r\nThis gives a more detailed view of arteries than can be obtained using ultrasound, CT angiography or MR angiography.\r\nEchocardiogram\r\nIn some cases an echocardiogram may be used to produce images of the heart using an ultrasound probe placed on the chest (transthoracic echocardiogram). In addition, transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) may also be used. This involves an ultrasonic probe which is passed down the food pipe (esophagus), usually under sedation. Because it's directly behind the heart, it produces a clear image of blood clots and other abnormalities that may not get picked up by the transthoracic echocardiogram."

STIs are of public health concern not only because of their high prevalence worldwide, but also because of their potential to cause serious and permanent complications in infected people who are not treated in a timely and effective way. These complications and sequelae include infertility, fetal wastage, ectopic pregnancy, anogenital cancer and premature death, as well as neonatal and infant infections. In addition STIs are known to facilitate human immunodeficiency virus infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS).\r\nThere are more than 30 different sexually transmissible bacteria, viruses and parasites. The most common conditions they cause are gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection, syphilis, trichomoniasis, chancroid, genital herpes, genital warts, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and hepatitis B infection.\r\nSeveral STIs, particularly HIV and syphilis, can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy and childbirth, and through blood products and tissue transfer.\r\nAccording to World Health Organization (WHO) more than 1 million people acquire a sexually transmitted infection (STI) every day globally. WHO estimates that 500 million new cases of one of four curable STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomoniasis) occur each year worldwide.\r\nSTIs/RTIs (reproductive tract infections) are an important public health problem in India. A community based STI/RTI prevalence study conducted during 2002-03 by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has shown that 6% of the adult population in India has one or more STI/RTI. This amounts to occurrence of about 30-35 million episodes of STI/RTI every year in the country.\r\nA large proportion of new STIs occur amongst adolescents and young adults who may not be aware that they are infected, which can have a negative impact upon their future sexual and reproductive health."

Flowcharts are used for the management of each syndrome provided as \u201cNational Guidelines on Prevention, Management and Control of Reproductive Tract Infections and Sexually Transmitted Infections\u201d 2014 by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India*. These national standardized treatment protocols for STIs help to ensure that all patients receive adequate treatment at all levels of health care services.\r\nEffective treatment is currently available for several STIs.\r\n\u2022 Three bacterial STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis) and one parasitic STI (trichomoniasis) are generally curable with existing, effective single dose regimens of antibiotics.\r\n\u2022 For herpes and HIV, antiviral drugs are available that can modulate the course of the disease, though they cannot cure the disease.\r\n\u2022 For hepatitis B, immune system modulators (interferon) and antiviral medications can help to fight the virus and slow damage to the liver.\r\n(b) Education and Counselling- Counselling is defined here as an interactive confidential process in which a care provider helps a patient to discuss on issues associated with STIs and to explore possible lines of action. Issues that should be addressed in a counselling session include:\r\n\r\nEducate the patient on his/her present STI and how it was acquired. Inform the patient that bacterial STIs are curable, viral STIs may recur, and the effects of not taking treatment properly. (Patients with recurrent genital herpes and recurrent vulvovaginitis are usually very distressed and need repeated counselling sessions).\r\nInform the partner(s) or spouse about the STI diagnosis.\r\nAssess the patient\u2019s risk for HIV and deciding whether or not to undergo testing for HIV.\r\nHelp the patient to learn about complications of STIs, such as infertility and congenital syphilis. \r\nInform the patient on how to deal with an incurable STI, such as herpes genitalis or genital warts, which may be transmitted to the partner (s) or spouse.\r\nEducate the patient on how to prevent future infections, including strategies for discussing and introducing condom use with the partner (s) or spouse.\r\nTell the patient about confidentiality, disclosure and the risk of violence or stigmatizing reactions from spouse, partner(s), family or friends and ways to overcome these.\r\nEnable patients to take control of their own life and their responsibilities for disease prevention.\r\n\r\n(c) Manage and treat partner -Management of sexual partners is based on knowledge of the index patient\u2019s diagnosis (syndromic or specific). The following three strategies can be adopted for the treatment of partners:\r\n\r\nOffer immediate epidemiological treatment (treatment based solely on the diagnosis of the index patient) without any laboratory investigation.\r\nOffer immediate epidemiological treatment, but obtain specimens for subsequent laboratory confirmation.\r\nDelay treatment until the results of definitive laboratory tests are available.\r\n\r\nWHO recommends that epidemiological treatment (with the same treatment regimen used for the index patient) should be given to all sexual partners.\r\n(d) Offer HIV Counselling and testing- A consultation for an STI is a unique opportunity to provide education on the prevention of HIV and STIs to people who, by definition, are at risk for these infections.\r\n(e) Follow up-Appropriate clinical follow up is a part of comprehensive case management of STI. The follow up schedules are prescribed for each syndrome in the respective flow charts (as provided by GOI*). Patients should be advised to return if their symptoms get worse or persist after the prescribed period of therapy."

                "Shaken baby syndrome (SBS) is a violent act of one form of child abuse, a non-accidental traumatic brain injury, which can cause neurologic, cognitive and other functional deficits. Retinal findings may be the only manifestation of SBS and then an eye specialist may initially recognise it. Cases should be thoroughly reviewed and prevention strategies developed to prevent further incidents. SBS has important medico-legal implications since the safety of child may be at stake.\r\nMaltreatment of children, including non-accidental trauma, is problematic for children, families and care providers. Death may result in most serious cases due to maltreatment. SBS victims can present with wide range of symptoms, from generalised flu- like symptoms to unresponsiveness with risk of imminent death.\r\nSigns of maltreatment may not be obvious. Detecting maltreatment requires careful attention of health care providers to ensure safety and care of victim, appropriate counselling of family, reporting of incidents to law enforcing agencies and prevention of repeat occurrences.\r\nIn 1946, Caffey described \u2018whiplash shaken-baby syndrome\u2019, a cluster of infantile subdural and subarachnoid haemorrhage, traction-type metaphyseal (wide portion or growth plate between epiphysis and narrow diaphysis) fracture, and retinal haemorrhage. This cluster of injuries was noted in many infants despite the lack of any external surface injury. Injuries were attributed to the developmental differences in infants head as compared with adults. Head comprises 25% of the total body weight in infants as compared to about 10% of total body weight in adults. In addition, infants have weak neck muscles, higher water content in brain matter and poor motor control rendering them more susceptible to injury through violent shaking."

                "Head injuries are the chief cause of traumatic death and leading cause of fatalities due to child abuse. Serious injuries in infants, notably those causing death, are rarely accidental unless there is a clear cause for the injuries, such as road traffic accident due to motor vehicle.\r\nThe majority of all cases of SBS are limited to children under three years of age. Shaking is generally attributed to the perpetrators level of tension and frustration, often generated by infants crying or irritability.\r\nRisk factors for non-accidental injuries include:\r\n- Young parents.\r\n- Unstable family environment.\r\n- Low socioeconomic status.\r\n- Unrealistic child-rearing expectations.\r\n- Infant prematurity or disability.\r\n- Rigid attitudes and impulsivity.\r\n- Feelings of inadequacy, isolation or depression.\r\n- Negative childhood experiences including neglect or abuse.\r\n- Crying of the infant or child may also play a role.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, parents or caretakers who have been involved in substance abuse and/or domestic violence may be at a higher risk for inflicting SBS. General demonstration of violence on television, radio and video games may also have a strong correlation with child abuse.\r\n\r\nParents may not be aware of the basic needs and normal development of their infant. Parents may have unrealistic expectations of the infant and a poor understanding of infant\u2019s developmental level and abilities. According to Fulton, infants can spend up to 20% of their waking time crying. To the parents and caretakers, infant may seem inconsolable, and frustration can quickly build up. This may lead to physical shaking of infant in an attempt to calm the baby. Episodes of shaking are directly proportional to the degree of frustration felt by the parent or caretaker, and they become the perpetrators of abuse resulting in child fatality.\r\n\r\nRisk factors of caretakers including babysitters, contributing to SBS, include their immaturity, young age and lack of life experience.\r\n\r\nSituations suggesting possibility of abuse are:\r\n- Infant presenting with a history that is not plausible or consistent.\r\n- Presence of new adult partner in home.\r\n- Delay in seeking medical attention.\r\n- Absence of primary caretaker at the onset of injury or illness.\r\n- Previous history or suspicion of abuse.\r\n- Unexplained changes in neurological status.\r\n- Unexplained shock and/ or cardiovascular collapse.\r\n- Physical evidence of multiple injuries at varying stages of healing.\r\nDuring shaking episode, rotational forces and differential movement of the brain in relation to surrounding tissues can tear the bridging vessels resulting in subdural haematoma. In addition, rotational forces lead to strains on the nerve axons in brain resulting in diffuse axonal injury. Head trauma seems to trigger a chain of events that result in cerebral hypoxia, cerebral oedema, raised intracranial pressure and vaso-occlusion. Displacing effect of subdural haematoma may lead to further ischaemia. In general, intracranial injury in absence of any significant accidental trauma is a significant indicator of inflicted injury.\r\nCervical spine epidural haematoma may take place in a significant proportion of abused infants, in addition to focal axonal injury of lower brainstem, superior spinal cord and spinal nerve roots. It is also thought that the effect of stretching at cranio-cervical junction during violent shaking may lead to apnoea, which causes diffuse hypoxia.\r\nMechanism of injury resulting in retinal haemorrhage is not conclusively known. Several mechanisms for retinal haemorrhages have been postulated such as acceleration-deceleration forces which cause damage via vitreo-macular traction. Other possible mechanisms include blunt head trauma, increased intracranial pressure due to trauma, sudden rise in intraocular pressure, hypoxia, extravasation of subarachnoid blood or coagulopathies.\r\nThe number, location, size and character of retinal haemorrhages varies from case to case, however, more severe haemorrhage may be associated with more serious brain injury."

                "The onset of symptoms is useful both in understanding prognosis as well as determining a cause. Timing can best be established by the history, clinical course and results of diagnostic imaging studies. When accurate, the clinical history is the most precise means for establishing a timeline. Elapsed time from the onset of injury can be estimated through the breakdown of intracranial haemoglobin as seen on diagnostic radiological studies.\r\nThe basis for the diagnosis of inflicted injury is a physical examination that conflicts with the history provided.\r\nThree categories are identified for parent or caretaker explanations of infant injuries:-\r\n- First category: First category include explanations of the child not being well including general malaise, fever, nausea, vomiting, having a fall or being dropped.\r\n- Second category: Second category include explanations such as dangerous use of household objects, including appliances and toys, rough play, or no explanation of the events leading to injury. Over the time, parent or caretaker may or may not offer an explanation and may have used the time to construct a fictitious reason.\r\n- Third category: Third category admits of shaking the infant. Very few caretakers do admit shaking, however, when they do, they often cite a history of attempting to console the child or prevent from choking on an object. Two to three explanations or stories are not uncommon.\r\nOne of the hallmark presentations of SBS is lack of external injuries. This may lead to a missed diagnosis even in most severe of the cases. Lack of obvious trauma may falsely minimise healthcare provider suspicion of possible maltreatment. In the event, any external injury is noted, it should be fully documented.\r\nRepeated physical examinations may reveal further signs of trauma.\r\nEvidence of other injuries including non-specific bruises, rib fractures, fractures of long bones, abdominal injuries and retinal haemorrhages should be assessed and documented. Forensic photography can aid in clear and accurate documentation of injuries.\r\nAn accurate diagnosis of retinal haemorrhage is crucial for appropriate medical care and for legal reasons.\r\nClinical features:\r\n- Ocular (eye) manifestations: A child with classic features of physical abuse should have detailed examination of eyes by an eye-specialist. A child may have signs such as:-\r\nPeriorbital trauma: Periorbital trauma like ecchymosis, lid oedema or orbital fractures.\r\nAnterior segment trauma: Anterior segment trauma may show hyphaema (blood in anterior chamber of eye), iris prolapse, corneal laceration or cataract.\r\nPosterior segment trauma: Posterior segment trauma may show vitreous haemorrhage, retinal haemorrhage, retinal detachment or avulsion of optic nerve. Macular retinoschisis (splitting of retina) may also occur.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat controversial whether retinal haemorrhage in a child is a definitive sign of SBS. It is seen that large retinal haemorrhages are unusual in other forms of head injuries and are found in about 1% of cases with serious head trauma.\r\n\r\nRetinal haemorrhages can be seen as early as 48 hours before any intracranial lesions can be found on CT scan or MRI of the brain.\r\n\r\nRetinal haemorrhages are the cardinal manifestations of SBS which may be seen in 75-90% of cases. Classically, children have multilayered retinal haemorrhages i.e. pre-retinal, intra-retinal and sub-retinal. Retinal haemorrhages are too numerous to count and extend from posterior pole to the retinal periphery.\r\n\r\nShaking can lead to permanent vision impairment and may be even blindness in more severe cases.\r\n\r\nThere may be associated brain injury which may result in nystagmus (persistent, involuntary and repetitive to-and-fro movement of eyes), cortical (cortex of brain) blindness or cranial nerve palsies.\r\n\r\n- Intracranial injury: The important diagnostic feature of SBS is the presence of intracranial injury in an infant. The most common injury is subdural haematoma. Other injuries may be epidural haematoma or subarachnoid haemorrhage.\r\n- Traumatic brain injury (TBI): TBI occur when a sudden trauma, such as violent shaking, causes shearing injuries of the brain parenchyma. Clinical features of TBI can range from mild to severe, depending upon the extent of injury to the brain.\r\nMild signs are:-\r\n-Headache.\r\n-Lethargy.\r\n-Dizziness.\r\n-Confusion.\r\n-Blurred vision.\r\n-Changes in mood and memory.\r\n\r\nSevere signs are:-\r\n-Nausea and vomiting.\r\n-Inability to arouse from sleep.\r\n-Seizures.\r\n-Dilatation of one or both pupils.\r\n-Loss of coordination.\r\n-Persistent crying.\r\n-Refusal to nurse or eat.\r\n\r\n- Bone fractures: Bone fractures can be found in half of all SBS cases, in spite of no apparent external injury. These fractures may take place anywhere in the body. Most common type of bony injury in SBS is the metaphyseal chip fracture. These fractures occur at the growth plate of bone due to uncontrolled swinging of extremities during shaking period. There may be rib fractures as well. In fatal cases, ribs are the most common site for fractures. In addition, whenever an infant presents with rib fractures, it is most often as a result of physical abuse. Posterior rib fractures are often due to antero-posterior thoracic compression such as that associated with a shaking episode.\r\nDiagnostic procedures:\r\n- Radiological examination: Skeletal survey should include radiographs of hands, feet, long bones, skull, spine and ribs. This should be performed as soon as general condition of the child permits. Diagnostic yield of radiographs is further enhanced by follow-up skeletal survey conducted after two weeks.\r\n\r\n- Scintigraphy: Scintigraphy is a nuclear medicine test which detects areas of increased or decreased bone metabolism, thus increase sensitivity of detecting rib fractures. Scintigraphy is of particular use if the child has to be discharged to a potentially unsafe environment, prior to two week follow up skeletal survey.\r\n\r\n- Computed tomography (CT scan): CT scan has primary role in imaging evaluation of a child with TBI. CT scan can detect injuries requiring immediate attention. Initial CT scan should be performed without contrast and is the procedure of choice for demonstrating acute haemorrhage, including that involving subarachnoid space. CT scan should be repeated after a period of time or if there is rapid change in neurologic signs.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI optimizes detection and assessment of intracranial injury including parenchymal haemorrhage, contusions, oedema and shearing injuries. MRI is also sensitive for detecting significant spinal injury and any parenchymal haemorrhage. A posterior, intra-hemispheric subdural haematoma, in the absence of significant accidental trauma, is indicative of inflicted injury.\r\n\r\nElapsed time from the onset of injury can be estimated through the breakdown of intracranial haemoglobin as seen on diagnostic radiological studies such as CT scan and MRI.\r\n(http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/344973-overview#a2).\r\n\r\n- Spinal tap: If a spinal tap yields bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a fluid which is xanthochromic (yellowish appearance of CSF) should arouse suspicion that the cerebral trauma may be several hours old and the blood in CSF is not from traumatic spinal tap.\r\n\r\nLaboratory studies for SBS are nonspecific and are not diagnostic. Leukocytosis is seen in about 50% of cases. Serum chemistry findings are usually normal, but it may reveal evidence of acidosis.\r\n\r\nSBS should be distinguished from conditions like:\r\n- Accidental head trauma.\r\n- Blunt ocular trauma.\r\n- Purtscher\u2019s retinopathy: Purtscher\u2019s retinopathy is a haemorrhagic and vaso-occlusive vasculopathy which shows multiple white retinal patches and retinal haemorrhages associated with severe visual loss. It may be associated with traumatic injury, primarily blunt thoracic trauma and head trauma, and numerous non-traumatic diseases.\r\n- Terson syndrome: Terson syndrome is the association of intra-retinal haemorrhage with subarachnoid haemorrhage.\r\n- Anaemia.\r\n- Coagulopathy.\r\n- Normal birth of baby: After normal vaginal delivery, retinal haemorrhages are occasionally seen without any intracranial lesions. Haemorrhages appear to be related to obstetrical and perinatal changes. These can occur with any type of delivery but are more common with normal vaginal or vacuum assisted deliveries."

                "Management should be strictly under medical supervision.\r\nThe identification, investigation, management and prevention of SBS require a multidisciplinary approach. There is a need for united effort among healthcare, child welfare, law enforcement, social services, education professionals and community at large.\r\nAll individuals and groups involved with detection, management and prevention should be provided knowledge of SBS. Creative preventive interventions, education regarding hazards of shaking and the development of appropriate coping skills can be disseminated to the community. The future well-being of children who have been victim to, or have the potential to become a victim of SBS, rests with the ability to work collectively.\r\nFinal outcome from inflicted injury is generally worse than accidental injury. Therefore, one must have a heightened index of suspicion for recognising patterns of injury of SBS. Although cause of injury may vary greatly, there are no differences in actual management of non-accidental versus accidental cases.\r\nIn suspected SBS, health providers should notify child protective services and law enforcement officials. Prompt notification facilitates a thorough investigation before the medical history becomes blurred by time. Early involvement of child protective services is also important for protection of other children under the custody of same caretakers.\r\nMedical care:\r\nIn addition to diagnostic team having specialists from various disciplines, treatment team should have health care practitioners who can resuscitate and stabilise the victim immediately. Follow-up examination should also be carried out by the same treatment team.\r\nSupportive medical care is the mainstay of management in SBS:\r\n- Blood pressure and vital signs should be maintained.\r\n- Resuscitate the child, if required.\r\n- Manage raised intracranial pressure, if present.\r\n- Some children require treatment for amblyopia or strabismus due to visual defect developing after SBS.\r\n- Antiepileptic medication may be indicated for seizures.\r\n- Physiotherapy and occupational therapy may be helpful after neurological injury.\r\n- Speech therapy might be of use for patients in whom speech and/or language is affected.\r\n\r\nSurgical care:\r\n- Surgical vitrectomy may be needed rarely for non resolving vitreous haemorrhage.\r\n- Surgery may be needed for subdural haematoma or retinal detachment."

                "Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) or \u2018hay fever eyes\u2019 is an inflammatory response of the conjunctiva triggered by exposure to seasonal allergens such as pollens, animal dander (flecks of dead skin cells and hair/feathers) and other environmental antigens. Intermittent (less than 4 weeks in duration) seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and persistent (more than 4 weeks in duration) perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), makes up a large number of ocular (eye) allergy cases. Most cases of SAC occur during the spring and autumn when the level of seasonal allergens (i.e. pollens) is high. In contrast, PAC generally occurs in response to environmental allergens (dust mites and animal dander) that are present throughout the year and is generally chronic. Majority of PAC and SAC affect both young and middle-aged people of both sexes.\r\nSAC and PAC are the common and sub-acute forms of ocular allergy, usually accompanied by seasonal allergic rhinitis. Although SAC and PAC are relatively mild conditions, rarely causing permanent visual impairment, their effects on the quality of life can be profound, with significant morbidity.\r\nThe seasonal incidence of SAC is closely related to the cycles of released plant-derived airborne allergens, or aeroallergens. The allergens that produce SAC vary from one geographic area to another, but tree, grass and ragweed pollens are the most common encountered allergens.\r\nAtopy (a genetic predisposition to develop an allergic reaction) is a genetically determined predisposition to hypersensitivity reactions upon exposure to specific environmental allergens/antigens. It includes allergic conjunctivitis, as well as seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), asthma and eczema. Allergic conjunctivitis is a type I (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction, being mediated by degranulation of mast cells (MCs) in response to the action of immunoglobulin E (IgE). There is evidence suggestive of an element of type IV hypersensitivity in some form.\r\nSeasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) represents a disease under chronic allergic conjunctivitis (CAC), together with perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) and, to a certain extent, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC). In seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival inflammation is quite mild and corneal involvement is rare. In contrast, AKC and VKC are severe inflammatory diseases, which may involve cornea and can cause permanent visual impairment.\r\nSAC and PAC are more frequently associated with rhinitis, while AKC and VKC are more frequently associated with eczema and asthma respectively."

                "Acute allergy is caused by IgE-mediated MC degranulation, whereas chronic allergies are also associated with continuous activation of MC but with predominance of mediators, such as eosinophils and T- helper2 (Th2) lymphocyte-generated cytokines.\r\nSeasonal allergic conjunctivitis is worse during spring and summer. The most frequent allergens are pollens from trees, weeds and grass, although the specific allergen varies in different geographic locations. Individuals with SAC have symptoms of acute allergic conjunctivitis for a defined period of time. In spring, the predominant airborne allergen is tree pollen; in summer, it is grass pollen; and in fall, it is weed pollen. Typically, persons with SAC are symptom-free in winter/cooler climates because of the decreased airborne transmission of these allergens. In contrast, PAC causes symptoms throughout the year, generally worse in the autumn when exposure to animal dander, house dust mites and fungal allergens is highest. PAC is less common and tends to be milder than the seasonal form.\r\nSeasonal allergic conjunctivitis can manifest itself through tear-film instability and symptoms of eye discomfort during the pollen season.\r\nPathophysiology:\r\nBoth SAC and PAC are type I (immediate) IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, due to environmental airborne allergens, with the mast cell (MC) playing a central role. A reaction occurs when a sensitised individual is exposed to a particular antigen. IgE has strong affinity for MCs triggering its degranulation. The number of MCs present within conjunctival stroma may be increased up to 60% in patients with SAC as compared to normal.\r\nAn allergen reacts with specific IgE antibodies bound to a sensitised MC, triggering cross-linkage of the IgE molecules and an influx of calcium ions into the MC. This causes the MC to degranulate and release preformed inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, which causes the signs and symptoms associated with the early-phase response in sensitised individuals.\r\nThere are two components of MC activation. The first is the release of pre-formed mediators, including histamine. The second is the synthesis of arachidonic acid and the subsequent metabolic cascade, resulting in production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.\r\nHistamine binds to Histamine1(H1) receptors and results in primary allergic symptoms of itching, burning, and stinging sensation and tearing, while binding to the Histamine2(H2) receptor releases leukotrienes and prostaglandins, stimulating mucus production and also increasing vascular permeability. This early phase response is immediate and lasts clinically for about 20-30 minutes. (http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/histamine/jm/receptors.htm).\r\nMC degranulation also initiates a series of cellular and extracellular events, which lead to the late-phase response (production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes). MCs also release cytokines and chemotactic factors which induce the production of IgE from B lymphocytes (B cells), enhance the production of T helper lymphocytes, attract eosinophils and activate vascular endothelial corneal and conjunctival cells to release chemokines and adhesion molecules. Chemokines and adhesion molecules mediate the infiltration of eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils and T helper lymphocytes to the site of inflammation.\r\nDegranulating eosinophils release toxic proteins which have cytotoxic effects and further enhance MC degranulation. These products of eosinophils are toxic to the corneal epithelium and, if present chronically, may result in ulceration. The late phase response is characterised by an influx of multiple inflammatory cells."

                "Diagnosis of SAC is generally based on clinical history and careful slit-lamp (bio-microscopic) examination by an eye-specialist.\r\nImportant features of the history include a personal or family history of atopic disease such as:\r\n- Allergic rhinitis.\r\n- Bronchial asthma.\r\n- Atopic dermatitis.\r\nSigns and symptoms of SAC and PAC are essentially the same and typically develop on a gradual basis but can also develop suddenly following contact with the offending allergen. The difference relies on specific allergens to which patients are sensitive and the chronicity of exposure.\r\nSAC remains self-limited without compromising cornea or ocular surface damage. SAC is usually bilateral, although it may be asymmetrical. If the allergic insult occurs with a particular allergen entering only one eye, ocular changes may exceptionally be unilateral. The symptoms and signs are recurrent, occurring rapidly following the exposure to seasonal allergens.\r\nIndividuals with SAC typically have symptoms of acute allergic conjunctivitis for a defined period of time, usually of short duration, that is, when the predominant airborne allergen is present. Typically, person with SAC are symptom-free during the winter months in cooler climates because of the decreased airborne transmission of some allergens, such as pollen. The severity of symptoms varies depending on the type of allergen, its concentration, and time of exposure.\r\nDry eye facilitates allergen contact with the ocular surface since the capability of tears to \u2018wash away\u2019 the allergen is usually compromised.\r\nThe most significant symptom in SAC is itching. Patients usually complain of intense itching of the eyes, sometimes along with a burning sensation and tearing. Discharge is usually serous, clear and watery, but with a ropy characteristic.\r\nWithout itching, the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis is suspect. With intense itching, the diagnosis of SAC is very likely, but one should also consider ocular conditions like dry eye, toxic conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis, blepharitis, and other forms of allergic conjunctivitis. In these other disorders, itching is usually mild and occasional.\r\nOcular symptoms of SAC may be associated with features of allergic rhinitis such as sneezing and nasal discharge.\r\nSigns of SAC: \r\nSigns on slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) examination may be:\r\n- Lid oedema.\r\n- Mucoid discharge.\r\n- Mild papillary reaction.\r\n- Conjunctival hyperaemia.\r\n- Chemosis may be apparent in the bulbar and lower tarsal conjunctiva, giving to it a \u2018milky\u2019 or pale pink appearance.\r\n- Dramatic unilateral bulging of the conjunctiva, frequently described as the acute formation of a \u2018bubble\u2019 in the eye, mainly when patients rub their eyes. Conjunctiva balloons, due to intense and acute infiltration of cells and fluids, causing chemosis.\r\n- Dellen (shallow saucer-shaped excavations in periphery of cornea) of cornea may form due to intense conjunctival chemosis and unstable tear film. Dellen may resolve with the resolution of chemosis.\r\n- Punctate keratitis may be present rarely.\r\nDiagnostic procedures:\r\nInvestigations are generally not required.\r\n- Intra-dermal skin test: Intra-dermal skin test is the standard clinical test for the diagnosis of type I hypersensitivity reaction. Cutaneous tests, such as the scratch, prick or patch, and more rarely, the intra-cutaneous injections, may be utilised to determine the antigens causing hypersensitivity. The prick test is the preferred method because it is more sensitive, less variable, and more comfortable to patients than the intra-cutaneous test.\r\n    Normally, skin test for particular allergens is rarely needed.\r\n- Superficial conjunctival scrapings: Superficial conjunctival scrapings in more active cases may help to establish the diagnosis by revealing characteristic eosinophils which are not normally present on the conjunctiva. However, eosinophils are observed in the most severe cases, but are generally present in the deep layers of the substantia propria of the conjunctiva. For this reason, the absence of eosinophils on conjunctival scrapings does not rule out the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis. Even the presence of one eosinophil or eosinophilic granules is consistent with a diagnosis of allergy. \r\n- Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST): Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST), a blood test, may also help to define the allergens. Elevated IgE levels in serum (RAST, ELISA) and in tear fluid are present in almost all patients with SAC. Tear and serum levels of IgE may be helpful in diagnosis, monitoring the level of allergic activity and the response to therapeutic measures.\r\n- Conjunctival provocation test (CPT): Conjunctival provocation test consist of instilling offending pollen into the conjunctival sac, producing the typical symptoms of SAC. Conjunctival provocation tests are rarely necessary for the diagnosis of SAC and it has rather proven to be a reliable method to evaluate ocular therapeutics.\r\n- Nasal allergy test: There is also a possible involvement of nasal allergy in some patients with allergic conjunctivitis, such as SAC, and therefore, there may be value to a nasal challenge with allergen combined with registration of ocular features.\r\n- Tear film mediators: Quantitative analysis of tear film inflammatory mediators is used as a disease marker and to understand immune mechanisms.\r\n\r\nSAC should be differentiated from conditions like:\r\n- Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) or Dry eye syndrome: KCS may present with conjunctival congestion and ocular irritation but no chemosis and itching is mild. In KCS, conjunctival congestion and punctate keratopathy are seen typically in inter-palpebral area.\r\n- Contact dermatitis.\r\n- Toxic conjunctivitis.\r\n- Blepharitis.\r\n- Other forms of allergic conjunctivitis.\r\n- Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis.\r\n- Bacterial conjunctivitis.\r\n- Viral conjunctivitis: Early viral conjunctivitis may be differentiated from allergic conjunctivitis by history of chronicity and presence of pre-auricular lymphadenopathy.\r\n- Occult foreign body: An occult foreign body beneath the upper lid may cause symptoms similar to allergic conjunctivitis. There is linear staining of cornea due to abrasion produced by foreign body.\r\n\r\nItching is a significant feature of SAC, but it is usually mild and occasional in other conditions."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nOne important goal of treatment is to prevent transformation of SAC to a chronic inflammatory process.\r\nGeneral measures:\r\nManagement of SAC includes reducing the amount of allergen exposure.\r\n- Avoid outside activities: Because SAC usually involves allergens, patient should avoid outside activities until late afternoon or after a heavy rain, when pollen levels are lower. SAC tends to be worse in warm, dry weather and to lessen with rain and cool temperatures. Patients should also keep windows in their home and car closed to lessen exposure to pollen.\r\n    Pollen can also be transported indoors on people and pets. Hair and clothes should be washed after being outdoors.\r\n- Wearing glasses or goggles: Wearing glasses or goggles can also serve as a barrier to allergens.\r\n- Air purifiers: Air purifiers that use high-efficiency particulate arrestance or high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration are more effective and safer (remove up to 99% of the material like dust mite faeces, all allergens, such as animal dander, dust, pollen, or cockroach faeces).\r\nSupportive measures:\r\nSupportive measures include:\r\n- Cold compresses: Cold compresses decrease ocular inflammation.\r\n- Saline solutions: Irrigation of ocular surface with saline solution facilitates removal of allergens, and thus achieves the primary principle of allergy management by minimising exposure of the ocular surface to allergens.\r\n- Artificial tears: Preservative-free artificial tears may be used to wash or dilute allergens and inflammatory mediators away from the ocular surface. In addition, some types of artificial tears provide relief through the lubrication of the ocular surface. Ointments or time-released tear replacements, used at night, provide a longer-lasting measure, delivering ocular surface lubrication during sleep. These agents are used for mild SAC only since they neither treat the underlying allergic response nor modify the activity of any of the mediators of inflammation. Artificial tear solutions should be kept in refrigerator, since the use of cold drops produces vasoconstriction, ameliorating symptoms and signs.\r\n- Avoidance of eye rubbing. \r\nMedical therapy:\r\nIt is important to note that in the treatment of acute or chronic forms of allergic eye diseases, patient compliance may not be ideal, giving the false impression of poor efficacy of medical therapy.\r\nMedical therapy includes:\r\n- Topical vasoconstrictors: Topical vasoconstrictors may provide short-term relief. Decongestant reduces chemosis, eyelid oedema, and redness by inducing vasoconstriction. There is also some amelioration of ocular itching with the use of topical vasoconstrictors. Like artificial tears, topical vasoconstrictors do not reduce the allergic response, because they do not antagonise any of the mediators of allergic inflammation. However, prolonged use of vasoconstrictors may cause rebound conjunctival redness and inflammation (\u2018conjunctivitis medicamentosa\u2019) (Spector S &amp; Raizman M (1994): Conjunctivitis medicamentosa. J Allergy Clin Immunol 94: 134\u2013136.), and they are ineffective in severe ocular allergy. To minimise this potential side-effect, exposure to medicine should be limited through less frequent dosing or shorter treatment durations. Examples include naphazoline, and oxymetazoline.\r\n- Topical antihistamine: Antihistamine eye drops are prescribed for the relief of acute signs and symptoms of SAC by blocking the histamine receptors in the conjunctiva. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus. For allergic complaints limited to eyes, topical anti-histamines are prescribed and are free of untoward side-effects of systemic oral anti-histamines. Topical anti-histamines provide faster relief than systemic anti-histamines and have longer duration of action than topical vasoconstrictors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pure mast cell stabilisers and corticosteroids, the drugs commonly used in the treatment of ocular allergy. These medications do not affect other pro-inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which remain uninhibited. Examples include pyrilamine and pheniramine.\r\n- Combined topical vasoconstrictor and antihistamine: Combined topical vasoconstrictor and antihistamine like antazoline (antihistamine) with xylometazoline (vasoconstrictor), may provide short term relief. Decongestant reduces chemosis, eyelid oedema, and redness by inducing vasoconstriction. The antihistamine is effective for the acute onset and reduces pruritus.\r\n- Systemic antihistamines: Systemic antihistamines may also relieve signs and symptoms of allergy. Oral antihistamines may be indicated for severe symptoms of allergy involving eyes, pharynx and nose simultaneously. Some, such as diphenhydramine, cause significant drowsiness and may be useful in aiding sleep.\r\n- Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms of SAC. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. The enhanced clinical efficacy of these medicines over first-generation anti-histamines like pheniramine may be due to inhibitory effects of new-generation anti-histamines on the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Topical second-generation H1 antihistamines are much more selective for peripheral H1 receptors, as opposed to the central nervous system H1 receptors, cholinergic receptors, and some H2 receptors that cause cardiac arrhythmia. This selectivity significantly reduces the occurrence of adverse drug reactions, such as drowsiness/ sedative action, dry eye and dry mouth.\r\n- Topical mast cell stabilisers: Topical mast cell stabilisers decrease the degranulation of conjunctival MCs, preventing the release of histamine and other chemotactic factors. However, the drug does not relieve existing symptoms and has no role in the treatment of the acute phase of SAC; mast cell stabilisers should be used on a prophylactic basis. They need to be used long term (treatment effect usually requires continued use over 5-7 days) or in conjunction with other classes of medications, such as antihistamines. Examples are cromolyn sodium, Iodoxamide, nedocromil, and pemirolast.\r\n- H1 receptor blocker and mast-cell stabiliser (Dual-acting agents): Dual-acting agents exert multiple pharmacological effects, such as histamine receptor antagonist action, stabilisation of MC degranulation and, subsequently, suppression of activation and infiltration of eosinophils. Examples are oloptadine, azelastine, epinastine and ketotifen. Drugs also exert anti-inflammatory effects through other mechanisms e.g. olopatadine affects release of cytokines. \r\n- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs): Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit production of prostaglandins (thus relieves itching) and have no role in blocking mediator such as leukotrienes. Example is ketorolac tromethamine and diclofenac.\r\n- Topical corticosteroids: Corticosteroid eye drops are very effective in treating SAC, but the numerous adverse effects, such as secondary infections, elevated intraocular pressure, and formation of cataract, make their use selective. Patients using corticosteroids should be closely monitored. Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids are broad and non-specific. Topical steroids must be prescribed only for a short period of time and for severe cases that do not respond to other therapy. Pulse dosing of topical steroids may be employed, followed by maintenance with an MC stabiliser. Modified steroids such as loteprednol etabonate and rimexolone may be used, and loteprednol has superior safety profile.\r\n- Immuno-modulators: Immuno-modulators such as cyclosporine drops and tacrolimus ointment have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of ocular allergy. Cyclosporine A is an immunosuppressant that acts by inhibiting eosinophilic infiltration by interfering with type IV allergic reactions in the conjunctiva. Tacrolimus acts mainly by inhibiting the action of T cells. Both agents are associated with fewer side effects and are preferred over chronic use of corticosteroids in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Immuno-modulatory agents are reserved for more severe forms of allergic conjunctivitis (such as VKC and AKC) and have limited indications in cases of SAC.\r\n- Allergen-specific immunotherapy: Allergen-specific immunotherapy is an effective treatment used to induce immunologic tolerance when the allergen is well known. The primary objectives of allergen-specific immunotherapy are to decrease the symptoms triggered by allergens and to prevent recurrence of the disease in the long term. It is indicated in patients who have evidence of specific IgE antibodies to clinically relevant allergens. Skin prick testing is the preferred method of testing for specific IgE antibodies and identification of allergen for the immunotherapy. Candidates for immunotherapy include those who:\r\n(1) Have symptoms that are not well controlled by pharmacological therapy or avoidance measures.\r\n(2) Require high doses of medication, multiple medications, or both to maintain control of their disease.\r\n(3) Experience adverse effects of medications, or\r\n(4) Wish to avoid the long-term use of pharmacological therapy.\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nPrognosis of SAC is good despite significant discomfort and undesirable cosmetic appearance. Allergic conjunctivitis generally clears up readily. Although, allergic conjunctivitis may commonly reoccur, it rarely causes complications or visual loss."

                "Spheroidal degeneration (climatic droplet keratopathy, Bietti\u2019s band-shaped nodular dystrophy, chronic actinic keratopathy or Labrador keratopathy) is a nonhereditary acquired degenerative condition of the eye. Spheroidal degeneration is characterised by sub-epithelial accumulation of spherical opalescent droplets that coalesce to form bands or nodules with elevated corneal epithelium. The degenerative process is mainly seen in the inter-palpebral part of the cornea.\r\nSpheroidal degeneration may have a distribution in the cornea similar to that of band shaped keratopathy, and it also occurs in the conjunctiva.\r\nBietti et al in 1955, made his initial clinical observation of an unusual degenerative corneal condition characterised by deposition of yellowish globules in the superficial layers of the cornea. Bietti\u2019s description of corneal degeneration, although it has been described by various names, is most commonly referred to as spheroidal degeneration. Fraunfelder and colleagues divided this condition into three basic forms viz.\r\n\r\nType I or Primary corneal type occurring bilaterally associated with increasing age and without any prior ocular (eye) disease.\r\nType II or Secondary corneal type associated with pre-existing ocular pathology or trauma.\r\nType III or Conjunctival type wherein conjunctival deposits are prominent with or without corneal involvement. Conjunctival form is found more commonly after the age of sixty years and may be associated with pinguecula.\r\n\r\nFrequency of spheroidal degeneration varies with geographic location and increases with age. It occurs most often in areas that have high sunlight exposure and sunlight reflection off snow or sand, in combination with wind-driven corneal damage by snow and sand. Probably it is caused due to micro-trauma from wind and sand or by solar radiations. This degenerative disease occurs due to excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. Males are more prone to develop spheroidal degeneration, especially those working outdoors, as compared to females."

It is hypothesized to be due to:\r\n\r\nDrying of the cornea.\r\nRepeated corneal trauma.\r\nWind driven corneal damage by snow (e.g. Arctic or Labrador region in Canada) and sand (e.g. in deserts). The specialised type of trauma related to ice and sand produces band shaped corneal spheroids arranged across the horizontal meridian.\r\nUltraviolet light exposure (confirmed also in the welding population). It may also be associated with blue light exposure.

Familial occurrence is very rare.\r\nAlthough spheroidal degeneration is classically associated with ageing and ultraviolet exposure, it has also been described in childhood with much less frequency."

                "Diagnosis depends upon:\r\nClinical features:\r\nSince spheroidal degeneration is associated with UV light exposure, patients may have other systemic findings of exposure to the elements such as history of skin cancer, pigmentary changes, or other actinic disorders.\r\nExamination should be carried out under slit lamp (bio-microscopy) by an eye specialist.\r\nSpheroidal degeneration is characterised by:\r\n\r\nFine droplets or globules: The presence of fine droplets or globules, yellow or golden in colour, beneath the conjunctival or corneal epithelium. The globules appear oily, although they are not of lipid origin. These may be clear but often become cloudy or opaque over the time. The accumulation of the globules primarily involves Bowman\u2019s layer, however, it may occur in the sub-epithelial area and superficial layers of the stroma once Bowman\u2019s layer is disrupted. The deposits in the epithelium may damage the corneal epithelium and the band-shaped configuration may extend to the center, leading to decrease in vision. The deposition of slight golden-yellow globules is variable from few globules to aggregate or diffuse globules occupying central portion of the cornea.\r\nLattice lines: Lattice lines may be seen in some patients. Lattice lines are short, fine, discrete, and measure about 1-3 mm in length. These appear clinically exactly like lattice lines in lattice corneal dystrophy. Some of the lattice lines are even seen deep in the corneal stroma. The lattice lines may be central, peripheral or bilateral. Lattice lines are seen among elderly patients and are observed in both primary and secondary corneal type. Lattice lines, unlike lines in lattice corneal dystrophy, occur late in life in the absence of family history and may be superficial and deep in the cornea. The lattice lines are usually non-arborising and lack orientation. The lines are thin, glossy and randomly placed, generally occupying the superficial layers of the cornea and close to the spherules. The lattice lines are not associated with painful recurrent corneal erosions and do not interfere with vision in patients with primary corneal type.\r\nFine greyish fleck like opacities: Fine greyish fleck like opacities are sometimes dispersed in between the lattice lines and beside the globules.\r\nAmyloidosis: Amyloidosis of the cornea in spheroidal degeneration may be non-specific and is not well understood. It is believed that a decrease in the serum amyloid degrading activity may precede the accumulation of amyloid in the tissues. Amyloidosis of the cornea may be the result of multiple micro-traumas by sand, dust, UV rays and other factors.\r\nCataract and pseudo-exfoliation of lens: Cataract and pseudo-exfoliation of lens are common among patients of spheroidal degeneration.\r\nIris atrophy: Iris atrophy has also been observed.\r\nDecrease in corneal sensitivity: Decrease in corneal sensitivity or hypoesthesia has been noted in one study.\r\n\r\nA clear zone may exist early on between peripheral edge of lesion and limbus, but is lost later on.\r\n\r\nType I or Primary corneal type: Primary type is characterised by corneal lesions that occur without other ocular or corneal disorders. The lesions are usually symmetrical and bilateral. In the primary form, degeneration begins peripherally and advances toward the center in the palpebral fissure area. As the condition advances, the droplets become larger and more nodular and lift the central corneal epithelium. The conjunctiva may be involved in patients with primary degeneration, especially nasally.\r\nThere are three grades of severity of primary form:\r\n\r\nGrade 1: Mild spherule deposition near the limbus. Fine shiny droplets are present peripherally only, without producing any symptoms.\r\nGrade 2: Moderate spherule deposition with band shaped haziness. The central part of cornea is involved with some diminution of vision.\r\nGrade 3: Large yellow aggregates of sub-epithelial droplets spherules reaching the central part of the cornea. There are large corneal nodules and vision is no better than 6/60 on Snellen\u2019s vision test types. Disease may be rapidly progressive, followed by ulceration of involved areas of cornea, with secondary bacterial infection.\r\n\r\nAlternative grading of the condition depending on the severity is:\r\n\r\nTrace: Trace is characterised by small number of deposits in one eye, or only at the end of the interpalpebral strip in each eye (if bilateral).\r\nGrade 1: In grade 1, there is sparing of central cornea with involvement of medial and lateral interpalpebral strips.\r\nGrade 2: Grade 2 affects central cornea but there is no effect on visual acuity.\r\nGrade 3: In grade 3, central cornea is affected with reduced vision.\r\nGrade 4: Grade 4 shows elevated nodules in addition to the findings of Grade 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nType II or Secondary corneal type: Secondary corneal type is associated with other ocular disorders, corneal vascularisation and scarring. Secondary corneal type may occur along the edge of corneal scars.\r\nSecondary corneal type is characterised by the presence of corneal scars and vascularisation with large and small yellow globules invading the epithelium, basement membrane, Bowman\u2019s layer and superficial stroma. There may be scarring within the adjacent layers of the cornea. The location of the globules depends on the degree of Bowman\u2019s layer disruption and the location of the corneal scars. Scars may be peripheral or central. The deposition is not always in a band-shaped configuration and can occupy the areas of the corneal scar. The disease may be either unilateral or bilateral. In cases with unilateral vascularized corneal scars, the degeneration occurs in the eye with corneal scars and may not occur in the other eye with clear cornea.\r\nRecurrence of degeneration may occur in patients undergoing penetrating keratoplasty. Globular aggregates may occur in the corneal graft and usually in the center of the graft.\r\n\r\nType III or Conjunctival type: Conjunctival type may also show similar deposits on conjunctiva as are seen in corneal type. The conjunctival lesions may have engorged blood vessels.\r\n\r\nHistopathology and Electron microscopy:\r\nStaining properties:\r\nPrimary spheroidal degeneration:\r\n\r\nUnstained sections: Unstained sections reveal auto-fluorescence in superficial stromal deposits under ultraviolet illumination.\r\nHaematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained sections: Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained sections of the cornea show evidence of homogeneous proteinaceous globular deposits of variable sizes in the superficial layers. The globules are mainly seen along Bowman\u2019s layer which may show disintegration being produced by the globular deposits. The spherules are then seen in the sub-epithelial space disrupting the basement membrane and the superficial stroma. The sub-epithelial aggregates of spherules may cause elevation and thinning of the corneal epithelium.\r\nMasson trichrome stain: Masson trichrome stain reveals reddish-grey colour of spherules.\r\nVerhoeff Van Gieson stain: Most aggregates of spherules stain positively with Verhoeff Van Gieson stain for elastic tissue.\r\nCongo red stain: Congo red stain is positive in the areas of amyloid deposits which show birefringence with polarising light in some specimens with degeneration.\r\n\r\nStaining for fat with oil red O and for calcium with Von Kossa stain is usually negative. Von Kossa stain may show positive staining for calcium in any associated calcification, but is rare.\r\nSecondary spheroidal degeneration:\r\nHaematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained sections of cornea: Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained sections of cornea show evidence of corneal scarring and vascularisation with homogeneous sub-epithelial globular deposits of variable sizes. Spherules may reach the superficial and even deeper layers of the stroma.\r\nElectron microscopic study: \r\nElectron microscopic study of the globules in patients with spheroidal degeneration reveals aggregates of extracellular electron dense round to oval globules among the collagen fibrils of the superficial stroma. The globules are of different sizes and cause disruption of Bowman\u2019s layer and the basement membrane of the epithelium.\r\n\r\nProteomic analysis and Pathogenesis:\r\nApproximately 105 different proteins have been identified using proteomic analysis. Primary degeneration shows irregular collagen from abnormal fibroblasts. Secondary degeneration shows protein deposits from the interaction of UV light and plasma proteins (diffusing through the cornea from limbal vessels under normal conditions).\r\nSpheroidal degeneration may be caused by an aggregation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and modified proteins resulting from UV radiation and ageing.\r\nCorneal globular deposits show protein deposits having amino acids such as tryptophan, tyrosine, cysteine and cystine, which are not normally found in the corneal stroma.\r\nMatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs): One study detected an up-regulation and increase in the level of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in the tear fluids in patients with spheroidal degeneration. TIMPs (inhibitors of MMP), where found as part of complexes in the TIMP-1, were significantly lower in patients. This study demonstrated that MMP-2 and MMP-9 tear levels were significantly elevated and may have resulted in delay in corneal re-epithelialisation and corneal scarring. The reduced expression of TIMP-1 in spheroidal degeneration, such as deficient anti-proteolytic shield, which may lead to rendering the corneas of patients vulnerable to enhanced MMP activity.\r\nAnnexin and Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH): Annexin and Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) are the proteins identified in patients with spheroidal degeneration using monoclonal antibodies. Annexin is found in the periphery but not in the center of cornea, while in spheroidal degeneration, it is found in abundance in the central portion of the cornea. Annexin and GAPDH are known for membrane fusion and allows cells to adhere to the collagen. The increased accumulation of Annexin and GAPDH in spheroidal degeneration as compared to normal cornea requires further investigation.\r\n\r\nSpheroidal degeneration may be differentiated from:\r\nThere do not appear to be other corneal conditions that resemble spheroidal degeneration of the cornea. However, conditions which may be considered are:\r\n\r\nBand shaped keratopathy: Band shaped keratopathy shows deposition of calcium with \u2018Swiss cheese\u2019 appearance.\r\nPseudo-entrapment of eye ointment: Post-operative entrapment of eye ointment in the stroma of the cornea does not occur unless the material is forced under pressure. These resulting droplets are not characteristic of spheroidal degeneration. The droplets do not autofluoresce under ultraviolet illumination and they are easily identified without the use of a slit lamp. The eye ointment cannot be trapped in the crevice of a wound for long unless a pressure dressing is applied. Once the pressure dressing is removed the pseudo-entrapment of ointment disappears.\r\nChanges in the conjunctiva: Changes in the conjunctiva such as cysts, lymphangiectasis, xanthomatous patches or the presumed forward migration of fat cells to the episclera from the orbital fat pads, are quite different from the spheroids of the conjunctiva."

                "Salzmann\u2019s Nodular Degeneration is a non-inflammatory, degenerative process characterised by whitish-grey or bluish-white elevated sub-epithelial nodules in the superficial corneal stroma that are usually bilateral, mid-peripheral and slowly progressive. There is usually a clear area before the limbus. It can cause blurred vision if it occurs in central part blocking the visual axis. It occurs more often in women than in men. The nodules elevate the epithelium. Peripheral lesions tend to be vascularised and may look like pseudopterygium.\r\nSalzmann described it as a dystrophy (genetic disorders characterised by deposition of abnormal material in cornea) in 1925, but it is a degenerative change that usually occurs years after some inflammatory condition of the cornea. He described it in association with keratoconjunctivitis, but with time, several different disorders coexisting with this degeneration were detected. To date, its aetiopathogenesis remains unknown, but it is considered to be associated with ocular surface inflammation or chronic trauma. The onset of the lesions is gradual and often occurs many years after the keratitis. The antecedent eye disease usually occurs in childhood. However, several cases with no previous corneal pathology have been reported and are considered idiopathic.\r\nThere are, usually one to nine discrete para-central lesions, often in a circular array at areas of corneal scarring or at the junction of old corneal scars and clear cornea. Each nodule is separated from other nodules by clear cornea, and iron lines may outline each nodule. The underlying stroma may be vascularised but the nodules are not vascularised."

                "Though the aetiology remains uncertain in majority of the cases, it is hypothesized that Salzmann\u2019s nodular degeneration can be triggered by multiple events that lead to a nonspecific corneal tissue reaction based on individual predisposition. It appears to be more frequent in middle-aged women, and may be bilateral in about 60% of cases.\r\nOcular surface disorders:\r\n\r\nMeibomian gland dysfunction.\r\nPhlyctenular keratitis.\r\nDry eye disease.\r\nRosacea keratitis.\r\nVernal keratoconjunctivitis.\r\nAtopic keratoconjunctivitis.\r\nTrachoma.\r\nInterstitial keratitis.\r\nExposure keratopathy.\r\nThygeson\u2019s superficial punctate keratitis.\r\nRecurrent corneal erosions.\r\nViral diseases like measles.\r\nScarlet fever.\r\nChronic blepharitis.\r\nTrichiasis.\r\nPeripheral vascularisation of the cornea.\r\n\r\nChronic injuries:\r\n\r\nExtended contact lens use.\r\nPrevious corneal surgery followed by actinic exposure, recurrent erosions, and chemical or thermal injuries.\r\nPrevious ocular trauma.\r\n\r\nRecently, Salzmann\u2019s nodular degeneration in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease was reported, and a hypothesis about association with systemic diseases was contemplated.\r\nGenetic causes have also been described.\r\n\r\nPathophysiology:\r\nOne of the hypotheses suggests that enzymatic destruction of Bowman\u2019s membrane results in migration and proliferation of keratocytes from the stroma, resulting in secondary deposition of extracellular matrix components in nodular areas.\r\nHistopathological studies have shown that the corneal nodules are located in sub-epithelium, but may extend to one-third of the anterior stroma and are formed by a dense connective tissue with hyaline degeneration. The corneal epithelium has an irregular thickness, with extremely increased thinning over the corneal nodules. The Bowman\u2019s membrane exhibits disruption, may no longer be appreciable, and frequently replaced by fibrosis. Sub-epithelial fibrosis is a frequent histopathological finding, with activated fibroblasts beneath the epithelial cells. Increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) was recently detected in patients affected by Salzmann\u2019s nodular degeneration, and this may be responsible for the induction of the basement membrane and Bowman\u2019s membrane disruption.\r\nImmunohistochemical analysis of protein expression in the basal epithelial cells suggests a high metabolic activity. This finding implicates the involvement of the epithelial cells in the formation of the sub-epithelial collagen elements seen in nodules. This in turn correlates with the clinical association linking corneal epithelial disease with the development of nodular degeneration.\r\nAutoimmune aetiology has also been suggested in terms of pathogenesis of nodular degeneration."

                "Diagnosis of Salzmann\u2019s nodular degeneration is usually made clinically.\r\nThe patients usually present with gradual, painless loss of vision for both near and distance. The combination of corneal nodules, corneal surface irregularities, and associated refractive error may lead to visual impairment. Visual impairment is progressive and due to an astigmatic defect produced by the nodules. Severe corneal irregularities in advanced stages generate high irregular astigmatism with severe visual loss. Patients may complain of reduced vision if the nodules are located in the central cornea.\r\nThere may or may not be a history of chronic ocular surface disease. Patients may also complain of a foreign body sensation on the surface of the eye. Elevated nodules can cause discomfort and epithelial erosions.\r\nClinical features:\r\nTypical clinical signs could be observed during Slit lamp (biomicroscopic) examination by an eye specialist.\r\n\r\nSalzmann\u2019s nodules: Salzmann\u2019s nodules are solitary or multiple white-to-grey or light blue nodules, elevated on the corneal surface, and located in the mid-periphery of the cornea. Each nodule is about 0.5 to 2mm in diameter and is not vascularised. In some cases, single or few nodules are present in one or more quadrants during routine ocular examination in asymptomatic patients, and sometimes, the nodules may invade the central zone. When multiple nodules are present, they have a typical circular arrangement and might be confluent in the advanced stages. A normal clear cornea between the nodules is a characteristic clinical feature.\r\nIron pigment deposition lines: Iron pigment deposition lines in the epithelium may be seen around the base of the lesions, and there is no further extension of these degenerative changes.\r\nRecurrent corneal erosions: Recurrent corneal erosions may or may not be present.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorneal topography: \r\nCorneal topography demonstrates the irregularities of the corneal shape produced by corneal nodules, and the induced surface alteration depends on their number and localisation.\r\nAnterior segment- Optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT): \r\nAnterior segment- Optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) allows the evaluation of dimension and depth of nodules, showing stromal extension that can help decide the surgical approach.\r\nIn vivo confocal microscopy:\r\nIn vivo confocal microscopy shows normal epithelium in the central cornea with rare sub-basal nerve fibers that display increased thickness with lack of branching. Nerve fibers in corneal stroma are also abnormal in that their branches are very thick and tortuous with highly reflective segments. These stromal nerves resemble regenerating nerves as are seen after penetrating keratoplasty. Deep stroma and endothelium do not appear to be altered. The peripheral zone of the nodules displays basal epithelial cells that appear abnormally elongated. Confocal microscopy showed an increased reflectivity of the anterior stroma and marked stromal scatter corresponding to the nodules, as a result of the presence of fibrosis. Highly reflective structures representing activated keratocytes are present in both peripheral zone and in the sub-epithelial stroma of the central portion of the nodules.\r\nHistopathology: \r\n\r\nHaematoxylin &amp; Eosin (H&amp;E) stain: Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin (H&amp;E) stain shows an absent or broken Bowman\u2019s layer and a thinned epithelium overlying the nodules, in addition to disorganised sub-epithelial collagen fibrils.\r\nLight microscopy: Light microscopy shows dense deposits of hyalinised, irregularly arranged collagen fibers anterior to fragmented, and sometimes, absent Bowman\u2019s membrane. The tissue overlying nodules displays an attenuated epithelium. The corneal stroma contains unevenly distributed mitotically inactive keratocytes and disorganised collagen bundles.\r\nMorphometric analysis: Morphometric analysis yields a thinned corneal epithelium overlying the nodules.\r\n\r\n\r\nSalzmann\u2019s nodular degeneration may be differentiated from similar conditions resulting in deterioration of vision such as:\r\n\r\nSpheroidal degeneration.\r\nCorneal scarring.\r\nCorneal astigmatism.\r\nCorneal abrasion."

In the case of deeper in-growth that involves the anterior stroma, after nodule removal, the excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy is usually performed for significant anterior stromal haze or to make the surface smooth. In some cases with deep in-growth, the anterior lamellar keratectomy becomes necessary.\r\nExcimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) is generally effective in establishing a uniform, smooth surface and in removing opacities causing optical degradation, while minimising induced refractive change. Nodules often have good results after PTK, but the condition may recur. PTK may be performed with or without topical mitomycin-C (chemotherapy drug used in treatment of cancers).\r\nLamellar keratoplasty: Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) is performed when Salzmann nodules extend to or past the mid-stroma. This procedure is rarely required. Recurrence may occur within the graft.\r\nPenetrating keratoplasty: Full thickness penetrating keratoplasty is usually not required. One study showed recurrence of lesions after several years.\r\n\r\nThe recurrent lesions are often not clinically similar to the original lesions but are indistinguishable histologically.\r\nThe recurrence of Salzmann\u2019s nodules after surgical removal can occur with varying prevalence rates and periods of time.\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nPrognosis is very good to excellent.

Illicit drug use causes mortality earliest in life, alcohol also mainly (65%) before the age of 60, while 70% of the tobacco deaths occur after the age of 60.\r\nThe use of different substances varies in different WHO regions as in Europe and South-East Asia tobacco use is the largest burden while alcohol is the largest burden in Africa, the Americas, and Western Pacific.\r\n155 to 250 million people, or 3.5% to 5.7% of world\u2019s population aged 15-64 used other psychoactive substances, such as cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine, opioids, and non-prescribed psychoactive prescription medication (WHO-2008). Globally, cannabis is the most commonly used substance (129-190 million people), followed by amphetamine type stimulants, then cocaine and opioids.\r\nPeople who inject drugs (psychoactive drugs for non medical purposes) are at increased risk of HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Around 13 million people inject drugs globally and 1.7 million of them are living with HIV; injecting drug user accounts for approximately 10% of HIV infections. The estimated global prevalence of hepatitis C in people who inject drugs is 67%.\r\nIn India opioids are commonly used by IDUs. These opioids include heroin (\u2018smack\u2019 / \u2018brown sugar\u2019) as well as pharmaceutical opioids (such as buprenorphine, pentazocine and dextro-propoxyphene). In the north-eastern region, heroin and dextropropoxyphene are the most commonly used opioids; impure heroin (smack), and buprenorphine are the most commonly used opioids in metropolitan cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. Pentazocine is the most commonly injected opioid in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Chattisgarh. In the states of Punjab and Haryana, buprenorphine is commonly used by injectors. As per the HIV sentinel surveillance report, HIV prevalence among IDUs in India is 7.2%. However, some states have much higher HIV rates among IDUs such as HIV prevalence among IDUs is 21% in Punjab, 18% in Delhi and around 12% in Manipur and Mizoram.\r\nPsychoactive substance use by drivers has been associated with impaired driving and increased accidents risk.\r\nHealth and social problems associated with use of and dependence on tobacco, alcohol and illicit substances can be prevented by greater awareness by individuals, families and societies to use appropriate public health actions."

                "Substance use problems can arise as a result of acute intoxication, regular use or dependence, and from the way in which substances are used. It is possible for a person to have problems from all of these.\r\nAcute intoxication can occur as a result of a single episode of drug use. Intoxication is highly dependent on the type and dose of drug and is influenced by an individual's level of tolerance and other factors. Problems may be-\r\n\r\nAtaxia, vomiting, fever and confusion\r\noverdose and loss of consciousness\r\nprone to accidents and injury\r\naggressive, unpredictable behavior and violence\r\nunintended sex and unsafe sexual practices\r\n\r\nThe term acute intoxication is most commonly used with regard to alcohol use and in everyday speech it is called as \u201cdrunkenness\". Alcohol intoxication is manifested by such signs as facial flushing, slurred speech, unsteady gait, euphoria, increased activity, talkativeness, disorderly conduct, slowed reactions, impaired judgment and motor incoordination, insensibility.\r\nRegular use- A variety of different problems can occur from using the psychoactive substances regularly ranging from physical, mental and social problems:\r\n\r\nspecific physical and mental health problems,\r\ntolerance (person no longer responds to the drug in the way that person initially responded),\r\nanxiety, depression, mood swings, irritability,\r\ncriminal offences,\r\nrelationship problems,\r\ncognitive problems relating to memory or attention,\r\ndifficulties with regular job or study.\r\n\r\nDependent use: Dependence is usually associated with more frequent use of a substance, and at higher doses than used previously. The problems arising from dependent use of a substance can be similar to those observed with regular use, but are more severe:\r\n\r\ncraving and increased desire to use,\r\nanxiety, irritability, gastrointestinal upsets and sleep problems,\r\nincreasingly dysfunctional in daily life,\r\nmarked tolerance,\r\ncriminal behavior,\r\nrelationship breakdowns,\r\ndifficulty stopping in spite of problems,\r\npossible withdrawal symptoms on abstinence,\r\ncontinued use despite evidence the use is causing harms to the individual.\r\n\r\nInjecting of any drug is associated with following risks-\r\n\r\nDependence\r\nOverdose\r\nPsyscosis\r\nVein collapse\r\nInfection\r\nLocal: abscesses and ulcers\r\nSystemic-HIV, Hepatitis C\r\n\r\nSpecific health and other problems due to individual substances\r\nSmoking/chewing of tobacco products\r\n\r\nIt is a risk factor for a number of serious long term health problems and increases the severity of diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes and asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.\r\nChildren exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke are at increased risk of health problems such as respiratory infections, allergies and asthma.\r\nPregnant women who smoke are at higher risk of miscarriage, premature labour and having a low birth weight baby.\r\nTobacco use is risk factor for cancers of lung, bladder, breast, mouth, throat and oesophagus.\r\n\r\nAlcohol consumption alcohol use contributes to a wide range of diseases, health conditions and high-risk behaviours, from mental disorders and road traffic injuries, to liver diseases and unsafe sexual behaviour. \r\n\r\nAlcohol consumption at unsafe levels is a major cause of premature illness, disability and death and wide range of social problems.\r\nWomen who consume alcohol during pregnancy are at risk of having babies with birth defects, learning and behavioural difficulties and impaired brain development.\r\nLiver and pancreas diseases.\r\nCancers of the mouth, throat and breast.\r\n\r\nCannabis-The likelihood of death due to cannabis intoxication alone is very low, although combination with other drugs can result in overdose and death. Cannabis use is associated with numerous negative health consequences.\r\nCocaine-Cocaine is a stimulant drug. There is a significant risk of toxic complications and sudden death, usually due to cocaine\u2019s effect on the cardiovascular system.\r\nAmphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) can lead to a wide range of physical and mental health problems.\r\nInhalants cover all volatile solvents that can be inhaled or breathed in. The most commonly used volatile substances include petrol, solvents, glues, sprays, lacquers containing benzene and glues or paint thinners containing toluene. The most common way they are used is to sniff them from a container, although some may breathe them through a plastic bag. The short term effects include nausea, vomiting, headaches, and diarrhoea. Higher doses can cause slurred speech, disorientation, confusion, delusions, weakness, tremor, headaches, and visual hallucinations. Ultimately use can cause coma or death from a heart failure.\r\nSedatives and sleeping pills: Tolerance and dependence on sedatives or sleeping pills can develop after a short period of use, and withdrawal from these drugs can be extremely unpleasant. Withdrawal symptoms include severe anxiety and panic, insomnia, depression, headache, sweating and fever, nausea and vomiting and convulsions.\r\nHallucinogens: These are the group of drugs that affect the user\u2019s perceptions of reality by distortion of one or several of the five senses (vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch) resulting in hallucinations.\r\nOpioids: Use of street or non-prescribed opioids (heroin and opium) can cause many problems for users, particularly as they are generally injected or smoked which can create further problems for the user."

                "Risk factors-\r\nSome risk factors that can influence a child for later substance abuse and other problems have their presence during different developmental periods of life. Many risk factors are related and tend to cluster together. Following are the various risk factors:\r\nPrenatal period:\r\nSmoking and drinking alcohol during pregnancy can affect a developing fetus with altered growth and physical development and cognitive impairments in the child.\r\nInfancy and childhood:\r\nInsecure attachmentduring the child\u2019s first year of life can cause a child to be aggressive or withdrawn and have difficulty interacting with other children or adults. Uncontrolled aggression during early childhood can lead to poor social skills and problems during preschool period.\r\nLack of classroom structurein the school environment can lead to additional social and behavioral problems in children and academic failure. At the same time, they may be exposed to greater availability of drugs, drug abusers, and social activities involving drugs. These challenges can increase the risk that they will abuse alcohol, tobacco, and other substances.\r\nParental abuse and neglect are commonly seen as part of the cause of drug abuse. An adolescent or pre-adolescent may be trying to gain attention from an inattentive parent or escape an abusive one by using drugs; prolonged attempts through drug use can be a cause of drug abuse.\r\nParental substance use can also affect child both directly and indirectly by disturbing family environment and poor parenting. There are increased chances of child abuse and neglect in such families.\r\nParental smoking in home can also expose children to secondhand smoke; putting them risk for health and behavioral problems as well as increasing children\u2019s likelihood of smoking when they grow older.\r\nAssociation with drug abusing peers is often the most immediate risk for exposing adolescent.\r\nMental illnesses can increase risk for drug abuse. \r\nGenetic factors also influence the person\u2019s vulnerability to addiction.\r\nMany people use substances because they have pleasurable or desirable effects, while others may use them to block out physical or psychological pain. Some people use these substances to increase their performance, to stay awake or lose weight.\r\nMethods of substance use-\r\n\r\nInjected with a needle under the skin, into a vein or muscle\r\nSmoked or inhaled through the mouth or nose, or inhaled by placing a bag over the head (bagging)\r\nPlaced on a mucus membrane (such as inside the anus or vagina, the nose or under the eyelid)\r\nChewed, swallowed or dissolved slowly in the mouth\r\nRubbed in to the skin"

                "Scabies is one of the commonest dermatological conditions in the world. It is a parasitic skin infestation caused by a mite called Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis. The mite is so small that it is not visible to the naked eye. It burrows into the epidermis (top layer of skin), lays eggs, triggering a host immune response that leads to intense itching in response to just a few mites, (scabies is a Latin word that simply means to scratch). Scabiesis a contagious disease primarily related to overcrowding and poverty. Scabies is transmitted from human to human by prolonged skin-to-skin contact with a person who has scabies. \r\nScabies affects people from every country, accounting for a substantial proportion of skin disease in developing countries. Globally, it affects more than 130 million people at any time and the prevalence varies from 0.35 to 46%. The highest rates are found in countries with hot, tropical climates, where infestation is endemic. Scabies is more prevalent in overcrowded communities with low socioeconomic conditions. Institutions such as child care facilities, group homes, and prisons are often sites of scabies outbreaks.\r\nDuring a case study follow up, 81% of inmates of an orphanage in rural area of Maharashtra, India, were found to be suffered from scabies and all inmates were successfully treated with mass scabies treatment and health education. An epidemiological study conducted in rural community has reported the prevalence rate of scabies as 13%.\r\nScabies infestation is often complicated by bacterial infection, leading to the formation of skin sores and further complications such as septicemia, heart disease and chronic kidney disease. Young children and the elderly in resource-poor communities are especially susceptible to scabies; as well as to the secondary complications of infestation.\r\nAlthough scabies is not a life threatening condition, yet it may be considered to be important from the public health point of view because of several reasons, namely it is found globally; severe itching is extremely distressing, social stigmatization; and indirect effects of various complications. Therefore more evidence for epidemiological links with cardiac and renal disease, better diagnosis, treatment, and public health measures are needed to control scabies."

Scratching the itchy rash can cause sores and secondary bacterial infection.\r\nThick crusts on the skin (Norwegian scabies)- Sometimes in immune-suppressed patients, including those with HIV/AIDS, or persons who have conditions that prevent them from itching and/or scratching (spinal cord injury, paralysis, loss of sensation, mental debility) a severe form of scabies develops; it is called crusted scabies. Another name for crusted scabies is Norwegian scabies. Crusted scabies is characterized by vesicles and thick crusts that can contain thousands of mites. Persons with crusted scabies may not show the usual signs and symptoms of scabies such as the characteristic rash or itching because of patient\u2019s altered immune status or neurological condition. However these persons are very contagious due to the presence of millions of mites and are important to identify as they are a significant source of reinfection to the rest of the surrounding community."

The mite is very small, barely visible to the naked eyes.\r\nScabies mites burrow into the top layer of the skin (epidermis), where the adult female lays eggs. The presence of mite proteins and faeces triggers an allergic reaction in the patient causing an intense itch.\r\nScratching can lead to infection of the skin with bacteria (particularly Staphylococcus aureusand Streptococcus pyogens), leading to the development of skin sores (impetigo). Impetigo can be complicated into deeper skin infection such as abscesses and immune-mediated complications as acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (kidney disease) and possibly rheumatic heart disease. Up to 10% of children with infected scabies may show renal damage in resource-poor settings and, in many, this persists for years following infection resulting to permanent kidney damage. Recurrent infestations are common.\r\nTransmission of scabies-  \r\nScabies is usually transmitted by direct, skin to skin contact from infected person to another person; such as holding a baby, sexual activity, sharing a bed, school children holding hands. Close interpersonal contact is the main way of transmission. Sometimes people pickup itch mite from infested items such as bedding, clothes and furniture. The mite can survive for 48 to 72 hours without human contact.\r\nPeople at risk are:\r\n\r\nPeople living in tropical countries;\r\nmembers of a household who share beds;\r\npeople live in an institution such as prison;\r\npeople with suppressed immune systems such as HIV infection."

                "Primary management of scabies: The aim of treatment for scabies is to suppress the discomfort due to the disease, to limit the risk for secondary infection and related complications such as (heart and kidney disease), and to limit the dissemination of the disease in the family and more widely in the community.\r\nProducts used to treat scabies are called scabicides, they kill scabies mites and some also kill mite eggs. Different topical scabicides may be used for the treatment of scabies such as permethrin 5% (caution in children aged under 6 months), 5% malathion in aqueous base, 10\u201325% benzyl benzoate emulsion or 5\u201310% sulphur ointment.\r\nUse of oral ivermectin- It may be used in very closed communities, such as homes for the elderly. The current recommendation is to treat every inhabitant of such community.\r\nSecondary management involves prompt treatment of the complications of scabies, such as impetigo using appropriate antibiotics or antiseptics.\r\nImportant tips -\r\n\r\nThe treatment should be applied to those with symptoms and contacts (usually whole household and sexual contacts). All persons should be treated at the same time to prevent reinfestation (transmission of scabies by the asymptomatic member).\r\n\r\nThe lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body with cool dry skin. Avoid hot scrub bath before application of scabicidal agent.\r\n\r\nScabicidal lotion or cream should be applied at bedtime to all over the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. In infants and young children, scabicide lotion or cream should be applied to their entire head and neck because scabies can affect their face, scalp, and neck, as well as the rest of their body.Particular attention must be given to areas such as the flexures, genitalia, between the fingers, under the fingernails and behind the ears.\r\n\r\nThe scabicidal agent should be washed off the next morning.\r\n\r\nClean clothing should be worn after treatment.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to ensure that children and infants do not put their hands in their mouths once the lotion/cream has been applied.\r\n\r\nBedding, clothing, and towels used by infested persons or their household, and close contacts (anytime during the three days before treatment) should be decontaminated by washing in hot water and drying in a hot dryer, by dry-cleaning, or by sealing in a plastic bag for at least 72 hours. (Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin and simply laundering of the clothes, towels and bedding or even storing them for a few days is adequate).\r\n\r\nItching may continue for several weeks after treatment even if all the mites and eggs are killed, because the symptoms of scabies are due to a hypersensitivity reaction (allergy) to mites and their feces (scybala).\r\n\r\nIf itching still is present more than 2 to 4 weeks after treatment or if new burrows or pimple-like rash lesions continue to appear, retreatment may be necessary.\r\n\r\nSkin sores that become infected should be treated with an appropriate antibiotic prescribed by a doctor."

Solar retinopathy may be due to looking at solar eclipse with or without telescope, sunbathing, religious gazing of sun, and use of psychotropic drugs.\r\nThe effect of light on retina is being recognised since the time of Plato, who gave description of eclipse blindness.\r\nPhotic (related to light) retinopathy is a generalised term used for retinal damage produced by light. This may be due to solar viewing or may be produced even by the use of operating microscope.\r\nPhoto-retinitis damages the retina through photochemical effects, associated with rise in temperature. Sustained viewing of sun for more than 90 seconds through a constricted pupil may exceed the threshold for damage of retinal tissues."

                "Silicosis is one of the most important occupational health illnesses in the world. It is a progressive lung disease caused by inhalation of silica over a long period of time. Silicosis is characterized by shortness of breath, cough, fever and bluish skin.\r\nSilica (SiO2 / silicon dioxide) is crystal-like mineral found in abundance in sand, rock, and quartz. Silicosis occurs most commonly as an occupational disease in people working in the quarrying, manufacturing and building construction industries. It is also reported from population with non-occupational exposure to silica dust from industrial as well as nonindustrial sources.\r\nExposure to large amounts of free silica may not be noticed because silica is odourless, non-irritant and does not cause any immediate health effects, but long-term exposure to crystalline silica-containing dust is associated with pneumoconiosis, and progressive massive fibrosis of the lung (PMF), lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis, and other lung diseases and airways diseases. In India, more than 10 million workers are at risk of silicosis.\r\nIn 1999, the Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR) reported that around 3.0million workers are at high risk of exposure to silica; of these, 1.7 million work in mining or quarrying activities, 0.6million in the manufacture of non-metallic products (such as refractory products, structural clay, glass and mica) and 0.7million in the metals industry.There are also around 5.3million construction workers at risk of silica exposure.\r\nIn India silicosis is prevalent in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Pondicherry, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa and West Bengal among the workers of construction and mining. Prevalence of silicosis in India ranges widely from 3.5% in ordnance factory to 54.6% in the slate-pencil industry and this variation in prevalence is due to the silica concentrations in different work environment, duration of exposure and the job demands.\r\nSilicosis is an incurable condition with its potential to cause permanent physical disability. As there is no effective specific treatment of silicosis, the only way to protect workers\u2019 health is control of exposure to silica-containing dusts and to detect cases early through monitoring of currently and formerly exposed workers along with proper management to reduce disability.\r\nFactory Act of India(1948) mandates a well ventilated working environment, provisions for protection from dust, reduction of overcrowding and provision of basic occupational health care. The main challenge of eliminating silicosis in India is in the informal, unregulated sectors of industry which do not fall under the control of the Factory Act of India. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) also emphasized for regulation of working environment, protective equipment to workers with proper health education.\r\nRelated links\r\nIEC Booklets about silicosis in Hindi by \u2018National institute of occupational health\u2019(NIOH), India may be seen at:\r\nniohenvis.nic.in/booklets/silicosis.pdf \r\nniohenvis.nic.in/booklets/silicosis1.pdf"

There is an abnormal chest X-ray in the beginning and then person will slowly develop a cough and breathing difficulty. \r\nAccelerated silicosis: This form of silicosis tends to show up five to 10 years after exposure to higher levels of crystalline silica.\r\nAcute silicosis: It occurs with short-term exposure to very high levels of crystalline silica.

                "Silicosis is caused by exposure to crystalline silica. Silica (SiO2 / silicon dioxide) is combination of silicon and oxygen. Silicon is very reactive, does not remain in the element form but combines either with oxygen and forms free silica (SiO2) or with oxygen and other elements and forms silicates such as asbestos. Silica and silicates constitute the bulk of most kinds of rocks, clays and sands.\r\nCrystalline silica is found in rock, brick, and concrete. Grinding, sawing, crushing, or drilling of these materials produce a fine powder that causes serious respiratory problems.\r\nThe silica milling industry provides basic raw material to a large number of other industries such as silica flour is used in glass and high quality ceramics manufacturing, as abrasive cleaner, inert filler in paint and rubber industry, in making of toothpaste, scouring powder, abrasive soaps, chemical filtration, metal polishing. These dust particles, mostly 10 microns in size and smaller, are too small to see, but can penetrate to the deepest part of the human lung when inhaled. Chronic inhalation of such respirable crystalline silica (RCS) dust can lead to severe lung disease, such as silicosis and lung cancer. Further silicosis increases the risk of developing tuberculosis. RCS exposure has also been linked to kidney and auto-immune diseases.\r\nOccupational exposure to silica occurs at workplaces in factories like quartz crushing facilities (silica flour milling), agate, ceramic, slate pencil, glass, stone quarries and mines. Silica flour in India is produced by small factories.\r\nNon-occupational exposure to silica- Silicosis is also reported in population with Non-occupational exposure from industrial sources and non-industrial sources.\r\n\r\nNon-occupational exposure from industrial sources occurs when dust emitted from above mentioned factories goes to the environment and affects people living in the vicinity. It is reported that in population living near to slate pencil industry in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, prevalence of non-occupational silicosis and non-occupational silico-tuberculosis was reported to be 12.6 and 6.3%, respectively.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the people who shape and polish the agate stones in workshops in their homes are found to suffering with silicosis along with their families and neighbors.\r\n\r\nNon-occupational exposure from non-industrial sources occurs naturally due to desert dust and sand storms in hilly areas. Some farming, construction, and demolition activities also contribute to the environmental exposure.\r\n\r\nCrystalline silica\u201d or \u201cquartz\u201d is a potent fibrogenic substance. Silica dust does not have any warning signal, because it is tasteless, odourless and non-irritant. Therefore, a large amount of dust may be inhaled by a worker without any warning sign. Various occupations where earth\u2019s crust is disturbed can cause silicosis."

Histopathologically, siderosis shows accumulation of iron within metabolically active cells. Cells of corneal epithelium, pupillary constrictor muscle, lens epithelium, trabecular meshwork, pars plana and retinal pigment epithelium all may be affected.\r\nVon Hippel (1894) distinguished two types of siderosis: haematogenous in which iron is derived from the blood, and exogenous in which it is derived from an intra-ocular foreign body (IOFB).\r\nSiderosis may lead to decreased visual acuity, iris heterochromia, brown- coloured deposits beneath anterior lens capsule and cataract formation.\r\nVisual prognosis for siderosis is fairly good in some cases, but it is preferable to remove intraocular iron containing foreign body, wherever possible."

                "Diagnosis depends upon clinical history and examination.\r\nClinically, the process of siderosis bulbi may be divided into three stages:\r\n\r\nLatent stage: It represents latent period following injury before manifestation of clinical signs.\r\nSpread of iron: It represents diffusion of iron through ocular tissues.\r\nDegeneration: Toxic effect of iron leads to degeneration of the tissues, particularly retina.\r\n\r\nStructures such as iris, lens and retina can appear rusty clinically and macroscopically.\r\nThe iris is stained dark so that heterochromia results (darker colour in eye with siderosis). It is due to reddish brown staining of the iris.\r\nIron in anterior chamber angle may be seen as scattered black blotches which may resemble malignant melanoma. Trabecular damage due to deposits may produce glaucoma.\r\nThe lens is frequently yellow- brown with clumping of rusty material in anterior sub-capsular area. Iron deposits are radially distributed on the anterior lens capsule.\r\nThere may be pigmentary retinopathy followed by atrophy of the retina and retinal pigment epithelium. These changes may lead to profound visual loss.\r\nThus, clinical signs of siderosis include reduced visual acuity, mydriasis, heterochromia, brown deposits beneath the anterior lens capsule and formation of cataract. Electrophysiological changes include abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) and dark- adaptation study.\r\nIntraocular haemorrhage may produce similar clinical and histopathological changes as are seen in retained iron IOFB. Iron deposition in tissues from an intraocular haemorrhage is known as haemosiderosis bulbi. Long standing cases may show trabecular meshwork degeneration and scarring.\r\n\r\nHistopathology:\r\nHistopathologically, siderosis is characterised by accumulation of iron within metabolically active cells. Cells of corneal epithelium, pupillary constrictor muscle, lens epithelium, trabecular meshwork, pars plana and retinal pigment epithelium all may be affected.\r\n\r\nHaematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and periodic acid- Schiff (PAS) staining: In H&amp;E and PAS stained sections, iron may resemble melanin granules , although they are usually somewhat lighter in colour, more irregular in structure, and slightly larger.\r\nPrussian blue staining: Iron particles are best demonstrated by Prussian blue staining, in which the iron granules stain deep blue, in contrast to melanin, which does not take up stain."

Notification of cases is done with the case-based web-based TB surveillance system called \u201cNIKSHAY\u201d (https://nikshay.gov.in).\r\nFree TB drugs are provided under the programme in the form of daily fixed dose combinations (FDCs) for all TB cases on the strategy of directly observed therapy (DOT).\r\nDOT is a specific strategy, to improve adherence by any person observing the patient taking medications in real time. The treatment observer does not need to be a health-care worker, but could be a friend, a relative or a lay person who works as a treatment supervisor or supporter. If treatment is incomplete, patients may not be cured and drug resistance may develop.\r\nScreening of all patients for rifampicin resistance (and for additional drugs wherever indicated) is done. For drug sensitive TB, daily fixed dose combinations (FDCs) of first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs in appropriate weight bands for all forms of TB and in all ages are recommended. Treatment includes two phases- intensive phase and continuation phase.\r\nFor new TB cases, the treatment in intensive phase (IP) consists of four drugs FDCs- Isoniazid (INH), Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol (HRZE) in daily doses (as per four weight band categories) for eight weeks and in continuation phase three drugs FDCs with Rifampicin, Isoniazid, and Ethambutol (HRE) are continued for 16 weeks.\r\nFor previously treated cases of TB, the intensive phase is of 12 weeks, where injection streptomycin is given for eight weeks along with four drugs FDCs (INH, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol) in daily doses (as per weight bands) and after eight weeks streptomycin is stopped, the four drugs FDCs (INH, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol) are continued for another four weeks. In continuation phase FDCs containing Rifampicin, INH, and Ethambutol are given for another 20 weeks as daily doses.\r\nThe continuation phase in both new and previously treated cases may be extended by 12-24 weeks in certain forms of TB like skeletal, disseminated TB based on clinical decision of the treating physician.\r\nPatients eligible for retreatment should be referred for a rapid molecular test or drug susceptibility testing to determine at least rifampicin resistance, and preferably also isoniazid resistance status. On the basis of the drug susceptibility profile, a standard first-line treatment regimen (2HRZE/4HR) can be repeated if no resistance is documented; and if rifampicin resistance is present, shorter regimen for MDR-TB (multi drug resistant TB) regimen should be prescribed according to WHO\u2019s recent drug resistant TB treatment guidelines.\r\nRNTCP has introduced a new drug bedaquiline for MDR-TB under conditional access programme in 2016 across six sites, with a country wide scale up plan in 2017-2020.\r\nNikshya poshak yozana: For encouraging good nutrition during treatment period financial incentive of Rs.500/- per month is provided as a nutritional support to each notified TB patient for duration for which the patient is on anti-TB treatment. Incentives are delivered through direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme to bank accounts of beneficiary.\r\nDetailed information about TB management can be seen at:\r\nNational strategic plan for tuberculosis elimination 2017-2015"

It is a chromosomal abnormality in which all or part of one of the sex chromosomes is absent or has other abnormalities (unaffected humans have 46 chromosomes, of which two are sex chromosomes). In some cases, the chromosome is missing in some cells but not others, a condition referred to as mosaicism or Turner mosaicism\r\nTypes of syndrome:\r\n\r\nClassic Turner syndrome - where one of the X chromosomes is completely missing\r\nMosaic Turner syndrome - where one X chromosome is complete in most cells, but the other is partially missing or abnormal in some way in some cells, there may be just one X chromosome or, rarely, two complete X chromosomes\r\n\r\nSex chromosome:\r\nBabies are usually born with 23 pairs of chromosomes. One pair of chromosomes determines the baby's sex. This pair is known as the sex chromosomes. One sex chromosome comes from the father and the other one comes from the mother. The mother\u2019s contribution is always an X chromosome. The father\u2019s contribution can either be an X or a Y chromosome. A baby girl usually has two X chromosomes (XX) and boys have an X and a Y chromosome (XY). The Y chromosome determines \u2018maleness\u2019, so if it is missing as in Turner syndrome, the sex of the child will invariably be female. A female with Turner syndrome has part or all of one X chromosome missing. This means the girl has just one complete X chromosome rather than two."

Scarring causes difficulty in eversion of eyelid.\r\n- Stevens-Johnson syndrome and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid: These conditions lead to symblepharon formation and fornix (junction of eyelid and eyeball conjunctiva) scars.\r\n- Involutional entropion with horizontal lid laxity: Horizontal lid laxity may be tested by snap back test. Examiner pulls lower lid down and observes the lid returning to its original position without allowing patient to blink. Normally, lid returns back quickly without blinking, but in increased laxity, blink may be needed for its return to normal position. The examiner can also pull the lower lid anteriorly away from the globe. In involutional entropion, lid may be pulled away by 6-15mm from the globe, as compared to 2-3mm only in normal lid.\r\nTrichiasis should be differentiated from conditions like:-\r\n- Congenital distichiasis: In congenital distichiasis, there is partial or complete second row of eye lashes growing out of or slightly behind the meibomian gland orifices. Eye lashes in this condition are thinner, shorter and less pigmented than normal cilia (eye lashes).\r\n- Acquired metaplastic eye lashes: Acquired metaplastic eye lashes may occur in late stages of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, trachoma and chemical burns. In this, eye lashes exit near the meibomian gland orifices and are associated with other changes such as keratinisation of the conjunctiva.\r\n- Congenital epiblepharon: Congenital epiblepharon shows an extra horizontal fold of skin which stretches across the lid margin. The eye lashes may be turned upward, particularly medially. These may touch the cornea but they rarely cause discomfort in the eye. In epiblepharon, on pulling the lid down, the lashes turn out and the normal position of lid margin becomes visible.\r\n- Entropion: Entropion causes inversion of eyelid margin and pseudotrichiasis. Eyelash produces irritation to the exposed surface of the eyeball. In congenital entropion, on pulling the lid down, the entire eyelid is pulled away from the eyeball, unlike congenital epiblepharon."

Infection with genital serotypes D to K can cause isolated episodes of Ophthalmia neonatorum in infants or inclusion conjunctivitis in adults. Genital serotypes do not cause trachoma blindness since they do not enter stable transmission cycles within communities. Serotypes D to K occasionally cause sub-acute follicular conjunctivitis but conjunctival scarring is rare.\r\nTwo phases, active and cicatricial (scarring) exists for the disease process.\r\nActive trachoma occurs most commonly in preschool children, with the highest prevalence in children aged 3-5 years.\r\nCicatricial trachoma is most common in middle-aged people. The age group in which cicatricial disease begins to appear depends on the intensity of its transmission in the community.\r\nRisk factors for active trachoma:\r\nIndividual-level risk factors:-\r\n- Having siblings with active disease.\r\n- Dirty face which attract flies.\r\n- Crowded sleeping arrangement enables exchange of secretions.\r\nCommunity-level risk factors:-\r\n- Inadequate water access for personal hygiene.\r\n- Limited toilet facilities and poor sanitation leads to increased faecal contamination of the environment which provides a breeding ground for flies.\r\n- Control of flies.\r\nRecurrent episode of active trachoma infection leads to blindness. Initial infection is confined to conjunctival epithelium and triggers an immune response. Repeat infection with subsequent inflammatory response results in tissue destruction, scarring, contraction and buckling of tarsal plate of upper lid, leading to cicatricial entropion and trichiasis, and corneal opacification by lashes rubbing against it."

                "Diagnosis of trachoma mainly depends upon clinical presentation.\r\nMost patients with active trachoma are relatively asymptomatic. Active phase resembles many other diseases in which follicular conjunctivitis is a feature.\r\nThe cicatricial phase has unique clinical features, which helps in diagnosing trachoma. Conjunctival scarring alone tends to be asymptomatic, though the associated disturbance of tear film (produced by scarring of mucous and serous glands) often leads to dry eye. Trichiasis causes foreign body sensation as well as blepharospasm. Constant rubbing of eyelashes may lead to corneal opacification and impairment of vision.\r\nWHO grading and clinical features of trachoma:\r\nSlit-lamp examination by an eye-specialist is required for grading.\r\nActive trachoma is characterised by muco-purulent keratoconjunctivitis. Conjunctival surface of upper eyelid develops follicular and inflammatory response. Cornea may have limbal follicles, pannus (superior neovascularisation of cornea) formation and punctate keratitis. Other extra-ocular mucous membranes like nasopharynx may be involved leading to nasal discharge.\r\nFollicular Trachoma (TF):\r\nFollicular trachoma is defined as the presence of 5 or more follicles at least 0.5 mm in diameter in the central part of upper tarsal conjunctiva.\r\nFollicular trachoma indicates active disease. This form is most commonly found in children, with peak prevalence in those aged 3-5 years of age.\r\nFollicles are germinal centers that primarily consist of lymphocytes and monocytes. Involution of follicles at limbus (corneoscleral junction) gives rise to pathognomonic lesion of past trachoma in the form of Herbert pits.\r\nIntense inflammatory trachoma (TI):\r\nIntense inflammatory trachoma is defined as pronounced inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva that obscures more than one half of the normal deep tarsal vessels.\r\nIntense inflammatory trachoma also indicates active disease. Thin tarsal conjunctiva develops a velvety thickening. Papillae may also be visible. Intense inflammatory trachoma indicates increased potential for significant conjunctival scarring and corneal opacification.\r\nTrachomatous scarring (TS):\r\nTrachomatous scarring is defined as the presence of easily visible scars in tarsal conjunctiva. Upper tarsal conjunctiva may show scarring as Arlt\u2019s line.\r\nTrachomatous scarring indicates past inflammatory disease and a risk of trichiasis. Severe the scarring, higher is the risk of subsequent trichiasis.\r\nThis form may be associated with the development of dry eye syndrome, but chronic low-grade bacterial conjunctivitis and dacryocystitis (inflammation of lacrimal sac) may lead to watering of eyes.\r\nTrichiasis (TT):\r\nTrachomatous trichiasis is defined as the presence of at least one eyelash rubbing on the eyeball or there is evidence of recent removal of in-turned eyelashes.\r\nThis is a potentially blinding lesion that can lead to corneal opacification.\r\nTrichiasis is due to subconjunctival fibrosis over the tarsal plate which leads to distortion of lid.\r\nSuccessful correction of trichiasis may help in restoring some vision.\r\nCorneal Opacity (CO):\r\nCorneal opacity is defined as easily visible corneal opacity over the pupil that is so dense that at least part of the pupillary margin is blurred, when viewed through the opacity.\r\nCorneal opacity reflects the prevalence of visual loss and blindness resulting from trachoma.\r\nThis condition includes pannus, epithelial vascularisation and infiltration only if it involves central cornea.\r\nLaboratory diagnosis:\r\nIn endemic regions, diagnosis is almost always based on clinical features.\r\nLaboratory investigations are mainly used in research.\r\n- Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs): Nucleic acid amplification test is the best laboratory technique, of which polymerase chain reaction is an example.\r\nNAATs have high sensitivity and specificity but are expensive and not widely available.\r\n- Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) assay: Direct fluorescent antibody assay of conjunctival smears is less sensitive than NAATs.\r\n- Enzyme immunoassay (EIA): Enzyme immunoassay of conjunctival smears is also less sensitive than NAATs.\r\n- Cell culture: Cell culture has high specificity but only moderate sensitivity. Cell culture requires a highly specialised laboratory and is expensive. Newer diagnostic methods have superseded cell culture.\r\n- Giemsa cytology: Giemsa cytology is microscopic examination of stained conjunctival scrapings for intracytoplasmic inclusions. This test is highly specific but has low sensitivity.\r\nHistopathological features:\r\nTrachomatous inflammation is characterised predominantly by lymphocytic and monocytic infiltrate with plasma cells and macrophages in follicles. Follicles have typical germinal centers with islands of B-cells proliferation, surrounded by number of T-cells.\r\nWith inflammation, there may be formation of papillae. Recurrent conjunctival re-infection causes prolonged inflammation and conjunctival scarring. Scarring is associated with atrophy of conjunctival epithelium, loss of goblet cells and replacement of normal loose vascular sub-epithelial stroma with bands of collagen.\r\n\r\nTrachoma should be differentiated from:-\r\n- Acute inclusion conjunctivitis.\r\n- Neonatal conjunctivitis.\r\n- Toxic follicular conjunctivitis caused by topical medications or other compounds.\r\n- Allergic conjunctivitis which shows typical cobblestone papillae.\r\n- Bacterial conjunctivitis.\r\n- Viral conjunctivitis.\r\n- Trichiasis due to other causes such as entropion."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) recommends the \u2018SAFE\u2019 strategy for the management of trachoma. The strategy was developed by WHO Alliance for the Global Elimination of Blinding Trachoma by the year 2020 (GET 2020) and utilises a four step approach:-\r\n- S (Surgery for Trichiasis): Eyelid surgery to correct entropion and/or trichiasis may prevent trachomatous visual impairment and blindness in individuals at immediate risk. Eyelid bi-lamellar tarsal rotation surgery limits the progression of corneal scarring. In some cases, it can result in slight improvement in visual acuity. Adjuvant single dose azithromycin is given at the time of surgery.\r\n- A (Antibiotics for Chlamydia trachomatis infection): WHO recommends oral azithromycin and tetracycline eye ointment for trachoma control. Azithromycin eye drops have also been shown to be very effective. Beneficial secondary effects of azithromycin include its treatment of genital, respiratory and skin infections.\r\nAim in treatment is to reduce the reservoir of Chlamydia trachomatis infection in the family. All family members, including infants, should be treated for trachoma. In hyper-endemic areas, whole community should be treated with antibiotics.\r\nSulphacetamide (topical sulphonamide) eye drops are also being used.\r\n- F (Facial cleanliness): Facial cleanliness in children reduces both the risk and the severity of active trachoma.\r\n- E (Environmental change to improve sanitation and increase access to clean water): General improvements in personal and community hygiene are associated with a reduction in prevalence and eventually the disappearance of trachoma. Environmental improvement activities are the promotion of improved water supplies and improved household sanitation, particularly methods for safe disposal of human faeces. The flies that transmit trachoma preferentially lay their eggs on human faeces lying exposed on soil.\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nPrognosis of trachoma depends on the severity of disease at the time of treatment, institution of appropriate treatment and the risk of re-infection.\r\nPatients with early and appropriate treatment have excellent prognosis.\r\nSevere disease may be stabilised, but vision may not improve once corneal scarring develops.\r\nRe-infection worsens the prognosis in a patient."

                "Toxic keratoconjunctivitis or Toxic conjunctivitis may result from topical preparations for the treatment of ophthalmic conditions. Topical ophthalmic preparations can confuse the diagnosis of toxic keratoconjunctivitis. Medications often alleviate the symptoms initially and only at a later time, sometimes years after initiating therapy, will the patient develop discomfort. Common toxic agents are glaucoma medications, preservatives, antibiotics and antivirals. Patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome) are particularly at risk.\r\nEbers papyrus from ancient Egypt mentions eye remedies including red lead, antimony, lead, sea salt, iron and sulphur (Magnus H. Ophthalmology of the ancients. In: Wayenborgh J, editor. Hirschberg history of ophthalmology, vol. 4. Ist ed. Oostende: Wayenborgh; 1998: 4-12). In 1864, Albrecht von Graefe reported a case of toxic keratoconjunctivitis following administration of topical atropine (Wilson 2nd FM. Adverse external ocular effects of topical ophthalmic therapy: an epidemiologic, laboratory, and clinical study. Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc 1983; 81: 854-965). Treatment for Glaucoma is of particular importance, since topical therapy may last for decades.\r\nMain ocular allergic diseases under chronic allergic conjunctivitis (CAC) are viz. seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), atopic keratoconjunctivitis and, to a certain extent, giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC). Contact dermatitis is due to exogenous factors and it may be produced by irritant or is allergic in nature. Irritant contact dermatitis, such as toxic reaction to eye-drops, is caused by direct damage. Toxic keratoconjunctivitis may be produced due to damage of ocular tissues by an agent, usually an ocular drug or a preservative. Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction to a particular allergen."

                "There is no single mechanism responsible for drug intolerance or toxicity, but a combination of these occurs simultaneously, or in sequence and cause symptoms.\r\nDirect toxic effects: Medications can be directly toxic to the conjunctival and corneal epithelium, damaging its structure and altering its function with or without an inflammatory response. Some preparations are directly toxic due to change in pH, osmolarity of solution, or due to photosensitisation. Direct toxic effects usually occur after the first contact and appear after a threshold is reached.\r\nThe cellular reaction may reflect the direct effect due to\r\n\r\nActive compound.\r\nAccompanying preservative.\r\nBreakdown products.\r\n\r\nImmunological mechanisms: Topical preparations can also induce damage through immunological mechanisms. These reactions are classified into following categories:\r\n\r\nType I hypersensitivity: Allergic reactions due to type I hypersensitivity are triggered by the union of allergen and initiation of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) - mast cell axis, leading to de-granulation and release of inflammatory mediators.\r\nType II-III hypersensitivity: Type II-III hypersensitivity is triggered by antibody-specific and immune-complex-mediated effects.\r\nType IV or delayed hypersensitivity: Type IV or delayed hypersensitivity is associated with marked epithelial and sub-epithelial oedema and infiltration by CD4+ lymphocytes and Langerhans cells (Langerhans cells are potent antigen-presenting cells of the conjunctival epithelium).\r\n\r\nIndirect mechanisms: Ophthalmic treatments may also be toxic through more indirect mechanisms.\r\n\r\nBacterial colonisation: Antimicrobials modify the ocular surface microbes and may favour bacterial colonisation by selecting resistant strains.\r\nDecreased local immune mechanisms: Corticosteroids may decrease local immune mechanisms.\r\nDecrease in tear production: Parasympatholytics and antihistamines may decrease tear production.\r\nToxicity to goblet cells: Preservatives may cause direct cytotoxicity to goblet cells.\r\nDetergent effect: Preservative like benzalkonium chloride may have a detergent like effect on lipid layer of tear film leading to evaporation of tears."

                "For the diagnosis of Toxic keratoconjunctivitis, a detailed clinical history is important. A common history is that the eye disease improved upon initial treatment, but the symptoms in eye worsened with continued use. Clinical manifestations resolve when the topical medication is discontinued. Patients often do not communicate the routine use of over-the-counter (OTC) eye preparations, such as artificial tears or vasoconstrictors. Hypersensitivity reactions to topical ocular medications usually take place early in the course of treatment, but toxic reactions usually occur after prolonged use of drugs.\r\nOne should be aware of topical anaesthetic abuse or indiscriminate use of topical antibiotics. It is important to obtain information on medication storage habits and to confirm expiry dates, since patients often keep previously used medicines and use it, if symptoms return.\r\nDiagnosis requires examination under slit-lamp (bio-microscopy) by an eye specialist. Staining of cornea and conjunctiva with fluorescein sodium and rose Bengal dye may be required to identify the lesions.\r\nClinical ocular (eye) features:\r\nMost common toxic reaction is toxic papillary keratoconjunctivitis, which occurs due to repeated use of irritating medicine. The effect usually develops two weeks after exposure to the drug and may lead to a decreased compliance by patient.\r\nPeriorbital Skin and Eyelids (ocular adnexa):\r\n\r\nOedema.\r\nPruritus (itching).\r\nUrticaria: \r\n\r\nOedema, pruritus (itching) and urticaria of the eyelids are characteristic of type I hypersensitivity.\r\n\r\nDermatitis: Dermatitis involving periorbital skin is characteristic of type IV hypersensitivity, specifically if it appears a few days after the initiation of a new drug. Dermatitis may rarely simulate seborrhoeic blepharitis.\r\nLacrimal punctum: There may be fibrosis and obliteration of lacrimal punctum, thereby compromising its patency.\r\n\r\nConjunctival features may be:\r\n\r\n\u2018Up-down sign\u2019 of drug toxicity: When patient looks up, the lower bulbar and forniceal conjunctiva show intense congestion. Inferior bulbar conjunctiva may also show epithelial defects when stained with fluorescein sodium dye. When patient looks down, the upper bulbar and forniceal conjunctiva are white and non-congested.\r\nPapillary reaction.\r\nFollicular reaction.\r\nMucoid discharge.\r\nPruritus.\r\nConjunctival scarring. \r\nConjunctival erosions.\r\nChemosis.\r\nHyperaemia.\r\n\r\n     Hyperaemia and chemosis are more subtle and difficult to assess.\r\nCornea:\r\n\r\nPunctate epitheliopathy: Punctate epitheliopathy predominates in the inferior-nasal quadrant, where there is maximal contact time between the drug and ocular surface.\r\nPersistent epithelial corneal defects.\r\nHurricane keratopathy: Hurricane keratopathy is the whorl pattern, seen with exaggerated corneal epithelial cell turnover. The corneal epithelium may be opaque and oedematous.\r\nCorneal ulcers: Inferior-nasal quadrant is also the usual location of corneal ulcers (with rolled edges) due to anaesthetic abuse, which resembles neurotrophic keratitis. There may be papillary response and intense ciliary flush.\r\nFilamentary keratopathy.\r\nCorneal necrosis.\r\nPseudo-dendrites.\r\n\r\nTear film:\r\n\r\nTear film break-up time (BUT) may be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistopathology:\r\nTopical ophthalmic preparations can confuse the diagnosis of Toxic conjunctivitis. Medications may damage structure and alter function of conjunctiva and cornea with or without an inflammatory response. Toxic effect of these substances may lead to infiltration of substantia propria, by inflammatory cells and fibroblasts, which eventually lead to fibrosis.\r\nImmunological mechanisms may lead to:\r\n\r\nType I hypersensitivity: There is release of inflammatory mediators triggered by the union of the allergen with IgE-mast cell axis.\r\nType II-III hypersensitivity: Leads to antibody-specific and immune-complex-mediated effects.\r\nType IV or delayed hypersensitivity: There is marked epithelial and sub-epithelial oedema and infiltration by CD4+ lymphocytes and cells of Langerhans.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiagnostic tests:\r\nMost tests are not practical or not widely available and are difficult to perform in the clinical set up.\r\n\r\nConjunctival Scraping: The presence of eosinophils and basophils on conjunctival scrapings points to an allergic reaction but it is relatively non-specific, since these cells can also be found in toxic keratoconjunctivitis. In clinical setting, this test is most often used to rule out infectious disease and allergy.\r\nConjunctival Biopsy: Conjunctival biopsies are reserved for confirmation or exclusion of autoimmune diseases and are usually reserved for the diagnosis of cicatrising conjunctivitis (e.g. pemphigoid). Patients, after long-term glaucoma treatment, may show squamous metaplasia of the conjunctival epithelium and sub-conjunctival inflammation and fibrosis.\r\nImpression Cytology: Impression Cytology provides a homogeneous cell layer for histological studies. Epithelial cells, goblet cells and inflammatory cells can be differentiated with immune-staining and can even be used for flow cytometry analysis, which allows measurement of membrane and cytoplasmic inflammatory markers.\r\nTear analysis: Tear samples can be used to measure levels of IgE or inflammatory cytokines, though they are rarely used except for research purposes.\r\n\r\nWhen tear samples are positive, skin tests and conjunctival allergen challenge may be of clinical value, but negative findings do not rule out allergy.\r\nToxicity of common ophthalmic preparations:\r\nGlaucoma medications:\r\nPatients with glaucoma frequently require topical treatment for many years to control intraocular pressure. Like all ophthalmic medications, any anti-glaucoma drop may initiate sudden allergic response. However, patients may develop a late onset reaction, appearing months or even decades after treatment. Patients present with foreign body sensation, conjunctival hyperaemia, and staining of the conjunctiva with fluorescein sodium and rose Bengal. Topical anti-glaucoma medications have been shown to reduce density of superficial epithelial cells and increase tear film break-up time (BUT). Severe cases may induce sub-conjunctival fibrosis and a pseudo-pemphigoid syndrome. Long term therapy may induce subclinical inflammation and increased postoperative fibrosis; hence, the long-term use of topical anti-glaucoma drugs may be an important risk factor for the failure of filtration surgery. Care of ocular surface and reduction of inflammation before surgery may be achieved, whenever possible.\r\nSpecific glaucoma medications can be associated with certain clinical manifestations. Pilocarpine and beta-blockers have been associated with follicular conjunctivitis and drug-induced pemphigoid. Beta-blockers have also been found to produce pseudo-dendrites and corneal hypo-aesthesia. Both epinephrine and dipivefrin may also induce a follicular reaction. Epinephrine is associated with pigmented adenochrome deposits in the conjunctiva. Alfa-2-adrenergic agonists may produce an acute allergic blepharoconjunctivitis.\r\nPreservatives:\r\nPreservatives are antiseptic substances formulated with the principal compound of eye-drops to prevent microbial contamination.\r\nMulti-dose eye drops contain antimicrobial preservatives. Many substances have been used for this purpose, including benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine, chlorbutanol, thiomersal, paraben esters, and mercuric salts. Preservatives are probably the most common cause of toxic keratoconjunctivitis. Repeated application of multiple medications may lead to significant accumulation of preservative in ocular (eye) tissue and thus, increased risk of ocular damage. Toxicity is more common in patients taking preserved medications as compared to those taking preservative-free eye drops.\r\nBenzalkonium chloride can disrupt tear film by detergent action, cause epithelial toxicity and irreversible corneal oedema. Thiomersal is a common cause of hypersensitivity reaction and follicular conjunctivitis. Chlorobutanol is an alcohol that increases lipid solubility and is normally well tolerated and has been found to be less toxic than benzalkonium chloride or thiomersal.\r\nAnaesthetics:\r\nAnaesthetics are inappropriately used by patients to relieve pain, but the action is short-lived and the drug may be easily abused. The indiscriminate use of topical anaesthetics is a well known cause of toxic keratoconjunctivitis. Proparacaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, cornecaine, and benoxinate, all have been associated with toxicity. Patient may have clinical features such as pain, swelling of lids, conjunctival hyperaemia or mucopurulent discharge. The most frequent manifestation is superficial keratopathy, which can be detected even after instillation of a single drop. More severe cases can have corneal ulceration and stromal necrosis. Toxic lesions are due to decreased blinking reflexes, tear film instability with loss of epithelial microvilli, and corneal desiccation. Anaesthetics interfere with cell metabolism, cell membrane permeability, alter function of cytoskeletal proteins, and decrease the rate of epithelial wound healing.\r\nTopical Antibiotics:\r\nTopical antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis and keratitis. The most used antibiotics are topical amino-glycosides and fluoroquinolones, followed by sulphonamides, macrolides, and chloramphenicol.\r\nAmino-glycosides, such as gentamicin and tobramycin can produce conjunctival and corneal hypersensitivity, pruritus and hyperaemia. Toxic effects of topical fluoroquinolones, even of the first generations, are less common than those produced by amino-glycosides. The most common corneal finding is a white crystalline precipitate after the use of ciprofloxacin. However, epithelial toxicity, due to the preservative benzalkonium chloride present in topical gatifloxacin, can occur. Suphonamides may produce mild allergic reaction. The most devastating complication of sulphonamides is the induction of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Photosensitisation after topical sulfisoxazole ointment use may cause sunburn of the lid margin.\r\nTopical antivirals:\r\nAll antiviral medicines may cause toxic keratoconjunctivitis to some extent. Idoxuridine may produce punctate epitheliopathy, erosions and epithelial oedema on cornea. In conjunctiva, it causes follicular response, subconjunctival scarring and may occlude punctum. Similar effects, but to a lesser degree, may be caused by trifluorothymidine and vidarabine.\r\nTopical antifungals:\r\nAntifungals used in topical preparations may impair epithelial healing. Natamycin, the most commonly used anti-fungal agent, is generally non-irritating.\r\nMiscellaneous toxic agents:\r\nAlmost all topical treatment, given enough time and frequency of use, may be associated with toxicity. One must be aware that substances other than approved medications may be in contact with the ocular surface. Substances such as mascara, eyeliner, hair gel, hair sprays, skin preparations, and virtually any substance with direct or indirect contact with the body may produce toxicity. Many a times, patients use home-prepared remedies for common eye complaints, and are often reluctant to disclose these.\r\nToxic keratoconjunctivitis should be differentiated from conditions such as:\r\n\r\nAllergic conjunctivitis.\r\nOcular cicatricial pemphigoid: Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid is characterised by auto-antibodies directed against adhesion molecules in epithelial membrane complex. It leads to chronic ocular cicatricial conjunctivitis, besides affecting skin and other mucous membranes. There may be subconjunctival fibrosis, symblepharon formation, fornix foreshortening or punctal occlusion.\r\nPseudo-pemphigoid: Pseudo-pemphigoid is a severe toxic scarring reaction of the ocular surface, similar to ocular ciactricial pemphigoid. Unlike ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, investigations fail to show any auto-antibodies in the conjunctiva.\r\nFactitious disease: Factitious disease is an intentional disease produced by patient.\r\nConjunctivitis medicamentosa: Conjunctivitis medicamentosa (medicamentosa is a potentially prolonged inflammatory state that can last for several weeks or months of rebound mucosal congestion) is caused by overuse of topical vasoconstrictors. It presents with increase in conjunctival congestion and rebound hyperaemia on discontinuation of medicine. (\u2018conjunctivitis medicamentosa\u2019) (Spector S &amp; Raizman M (1994): Conjunctivitis medicamentosa. J Allergy Clin Immunol 94: 134\u2013136.)."

Diwali festival also marks end of month Ashwin and beginning of Kartik month of Indian calendar, and it falls in the month of October or November every year.\r\nFirecrackers are extensively used during festivals and festivities in India. Fireworks are used during celebrations because of sound produced, sparkle and sudden burst of colours. Whenever firecrackers are used, there is always a risk of burn and injury. Crackers also cause noise/ air pollution and may aggravate systemic diseases like bronchial asthma.\r\nThe chemicals released by the firecrackers are also harmful. Chemicals in fireworks include sulphur dioxide, lead, cadmium, copper, magnesium, nitrate and nitrite.\r\nFirecrackers release chemical pollutants such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.\r\nMagnesium hydroxide is found in sparklers and flares; the combination of thermal injury and chemical injury accounts for more severe injury than that being produced by either type alone.\r\nFacial burns are a frequent component of thermal injury and ocular involvement may be a part of it in some patients. The lids, especially the margins, are selectively protected from burns. This is because protractor spasm causes orbital and preseptal tissue to overlap and cover the tarsal region. The incidence of lid involvement is increased with more extensive burns. This is especially true when patients are unconscious secondary to an explosion or smoke inhalation and the protective reflexes are not intact. Fortunately, thermal injury is not commonly associated with severe ocular sequelae, courtesy of inherent protective mechanism, such as blink reflex, Bell\u2019s phenomenon, and reflex shielding movements of the head and arms. The loss of an eye primarily from thermal trauma is uncommon and the risk of permanent visual impairment can be minimised with effective timely treatment. Involvement of the eyelids and lid margins is the most frequent ophthalmic manifestation. With thermal injury, eyelid damage leads to necrosis of tissues, eschar formation, and, finally, quantitative loss of tissue. Therefore, the eyelid and conjunctival support system of the cornea is compromised, further embarrassing any corneal or anterior segment pathology. Chronic exposure keratitis is one of the greatest threats to corneal integrity and visual rehabilitation. However, ocular trauma may occur in the absence of eyelid injury and all patients who have been exposed to fumes, heat and smoke warrant comprehensive eye examination.\r\nDirect thermal damage to the cornea produces collagen shrinkage, with prominent stress lines radiating away from the area of greatest injury, especially in case of hot metal contact to the surface. This shrinkage might be severe enough to make the cornea distorted and opaque, leading to steepening of the axis of severest injury. Collagen damage may be so severe as to produce a rapidly excavating corneal ulcer originating from liquefactive necrosis. The post-injury phases of thermal injuries have not been studied as comprehensively as chemical injuries.\r\nWhen both thermal and chemical injuries occur simultaneously, the terms \u2018thermal-alkali injury\u2019 or \u2018alkali-thermal injury\u2019 might be used, with the most prominent injurious agent stated first. Thermal injuries associated with acid injuries may be referred to in a similar way."

                "Thermal injuries result from accidents associated with firework explosion, steam, boiling water, or molten metal. Thermal burns include those caused by a flame, which are usually severe with deep tissue injury, and those caused by flash accidents, such as explosions or electrical arcs, which are usually more superficial but may be extensive. The thermal injury is immediate and non-progressive.\r\nThe majority of ocular thermal injuries can be divided into:\r\n\r\nFlame burns: Flame burns are secondary to fire. They tend to be deep dermal or full thickness.\r\nScalds: Scalds may be caused by spilling hot drinks or liquids or being exposed to hot bathing water. Scalds tend to cause superficial to superficial dermal burns.\r\nContact burns: Contact burns are the result of direct exposure to a hot object. Contact burns tend to be deep dermal or full thickness.\r\n\r\nThe severity of burns depends upon the intensity of the burning agent, both the quantity of heat transmitted by the burning agent and amount of the burning agent, the duration of exposure, use of protective device, body response, any first aid or irrigation of the affected eye.\r\nMost of the flash burns are superficial but may be extensive. In burns due to flames, the period of exposure is longer and it results in deep burns.\r\nLiquid thermal burns vary in severity depending on the substance. Injury due to steam and also due to explosion of liquids on removal from microwave may splash into the eye and cause burns. The temperature of non- combustible liquid like water is usually less on body contact, and such liquids dissipate rapidly from the initial contact area, thereby causing superficial burns only. The temperature of combustible liquids (e.g. petrol), is usually high on contact with the body. These liquids are more viscous and may burn the clothes as well. Therefore, the damage is more localised but may be deep.\r\n\r\nPathophysiology:\r\nEyelid injury:\r\nThe skin is made up of two layers:\r\n\r\nSuperficial epidermis.\r\nDeeper thicker dermal layer.\r\n\r\nThese layers cover the subcutaneous tissues and a deeper muscular layer.\r\nJackson (1953) described three zones of burn:\r\n\r\nZone of coagulation: Zone of coagulation occurs at the point of maximum damage. There is irreversible tissue loss due to coagulation of the constituent proteins. Tissue in this zone must be d\u00e9brided. The zone of coagulation is surrounded by the zone of stasis.\r\nZone of stasis: The surrounding zone of stasis is characterised by decreased tissue perfusion due to vasoconstriction and ischaemia. The tissue in this zone is potentially salvageable. The zone of stasis is surrounded by zone of hyperaemia.\r\nZone of hyperaemia: In this outermost zone of hyperaemia, tissue perfusion is increased due to vasodilatation. The tissue in this zone typically remains viable. The tissue here invariably recovers unless there is severe sepsis or prolonged hypo-perfusion.\r\n\r\nThese three zones of burn are three dimensional, and loss of tissue in the zone of stasis will lead to the wound deepening as well as widening.\r\nHealing process of eyelid thermal injuries:\r\nRe-epithelialisation of wounds occurs from epithelium located at wound edges and skin appendages. In large epithelial defects, granulation tissue bridges the wound before epithelialisation. Wound contraction takes place in second- and third-degree burns and aids in restoring epithelial continuity. The property of wound contraction distorts the eyelids and hampers their function. Owing to the thinness of skin and absence of subcutaneous fat and rich blood supply, the slough on the lid separates early. The raw surface needs to be grafted, if contraction of wound is to be avoided.\r\n\r\nAdjacent soft tissue injuries (e.g. cheek, forehead): In adjacent soft tissue injuries, skin contraction displaces the eyelids which might pull the canthus. Injuries affecting lower lid tends to be more severe, due to less available loose skin.\r\n\r\nThermal ocular injury:\r\nThe severity of thermal ocular injury is a function of the thermal dose and the surface area of contact. A thermal dose can be defined by a time-temperature relationship. Goldblatt et al. explored the limits of thermal tolerance in animal models, by applying well-defined heat doses (time x temperature) and examined the effects on the tissue. They found that a heat dose of 45\u02da celsius resulted in no perceptible damage to the cornea when applied for 15 minutes, and produced mild transient stromal oedema only when applied for 45 minutes.\r\nHigher thermal exposure produced damage with total destruction of cellular elements, massive oedema and stromal disorganisation at a temperature of 59\u02da celsius for 45 minutes. This degree of thermal exposure resulted in severe degeneration of all structures and total necrosis at one week.\r\n\r\nThermal injuries to the conjunctiva may be iatrogenic sometimes e.g. after the use of triple freeze- thaw technique during removal of conjunctival tumours. Thermal response includes:\r\n\r\n\r\n- Initial phase: Initial phase comprises of tissue destruction.\r\n- An interval reactive phase.\r\n- Period of tissue repair.\r\n\r\nMinor thermal injuriesare typically limited to the conjunctival epithelium. Migration of peripheral epithelial cells then heals the ulceration with no scarring. Deeper injuries involve the stromal connective tissue and may cause coagulation necrosis. The healing process is prolonged and may result in significant scarring.\r\nAberrant wound healingmay result in a vascularised, hypertrophic scar that mimics a pterygium, but it usually lacks the stromal elastosis as seen in pterygium. This scar may encroach on the corneal surface like a pterygium.\r\nExcessive wound healingmay also result in a so-called pyogenic granuloma. This rapidly growing and protruding lesion is histologically defined by vascularised, oedematous granulation tissue with abundance of inflammatory cells.\r\nThe lining epithelium may be eroded, and pyogenic granuloma may bleed intermittently.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn thermal injuries to the cornea, actual burn to the surface is rare, but the injury is usually secondary to exposure, drying, and infection due to deep eyelid burns and is, therefore, preventable. In severe thermal burns, there is corneal opacification associated with extensive and deep damage to the tissues. Direct thermal damage to the cornea produces collagen shrinkage, with prominent stress lines. This shrinkage might be severe enough to make the cornea distorted, leading to steepening of the axis of severest injury. Collagen damage may be so severe as to produce a rapidly excavating corneal ulcer originating from liquefactive necrosis. Globe rupture is seen in extreme cases."

                "Patients with ocular thermal trauma should undergo early evaluation of the eye to assess the extent of the injury and exclude the possibility of an intraocular or intraorbital foreign body. The frequency of eye examination must balance the risk of ocular sequelae with the risk of contamination.\r\nDiagnosis requires:\r\nExamination of eyelids and adjacent tissues:\r\n\r\nThe depth and extent of burns in the eyelids and adjacent areas should be assessed initially.\r\nThe presence or absence of eyebrow hair and eyelashes should be well documented. Presence of these indicates sparing of the eyelid margin. Loss of these is associated with a deep partial-thickness or full-thickness burn.\r\nBell\u2019s phenomenon: Bell\u2019s phenomenon is a protective reflex in which eyeball is seen turned upwards and slightly outwards during eyelid closure to avoid corneal exposure. The presence or absence of Bell\u2019s phenomenon should be documented. In the presence of a partial- thickness burn, eyelid contracture produces progressive lagophthalmos (inability to close the eyelids completely) and corneal exposure. A good Bell\u2019s phenomenon may help prevent a corneal epithelial defect even in the presence of significant lagophthalmos. Absence of Bell\u2019s phenomenon may cause increased conjunctival redness, chemosis, corneal exposure, or mucous discharge and needs prompt surgery.\r\nForeign bodies, if any.\r\n\r\nBurns are categorised into degrees depending on the depth and extent of injury.\r\nDegrees of burns:\r\n\r\nEpidermal burns (First-degree burns): Epidermal burns (First-degree burns) involve the epidermis. First-degree burn usually does not produce any deformity. Pain is due to local vasodilator prostaglandins, and healing is usually complete within a week.\r\nPartial-thickness burns (Second-degree burns): Partial-thickness burns (Second-degree burns) include injury to the dermis, formation of blisters, and swelling. There is subcuticular or dermal fibrosis with sparing of orbicularis oculi muscle fibers. Partial-thickness burns are commonly divided into superficial and deep.\r\n\r\nSuperficial partial-thickness burns affect epidermis and superficial dermis and results in thin-walled, fluid-filled blisters with a moist red base. The exposure of superficial nerves makes these injuries painful. Burn usually heals spontaneously within two weeks without significant scarring or with minimal scarring only.\r\nDeep partial-thickness burns have a pale white or mottled base beneath the blisters. Healing takes three or more weeks, and is accompanied by scarring and contraction. Deeper second-degree burn leads to scar formation and contracture of wound, producing ectropion. These often necessitate early surgery for contraction and eyelid retraction.\r\n\r\nFull-thickness burns (Third-degree burns): Full- thickness burns (Third-degree burns) destroy epidermis, dermis, and all regenerative elements. There may be involvement of deeper structures as well. The skin is dry, leathery, and affected tissue is avascular and white. In the lids this appearance may be followed by oedema of the underlying tissues. The wound heals from the edges by eschar formation, followed by proliferation of granulation tissue and marked wound contraction, which may cause more severe ectropion and lid shortening. Such burns are typically painless due to loss of sensation in the involved area. Early excision of the affected tissue and skin grafting is almost always required to cover burnt area, which prevents secondary corneal complications.\r\n\r\nSome advocate full-thickness burns with destruction of underlying muscle, bone and vital structures, separately as deep burns (Fourth-degree burns). Such burns require extensive and complex management and often result in severe contracture and prolonged disability.\r\nBased on degrees and the likelihood of surgery, eyelid burns may be classified as:\r\n\r\nMinimal burns: Minimal burns are superficial partial-thickness burns that usually heal and do not require any surgery.\r\nModerate burns: Moderate burns refer to deep partial-thickness burns that show delayed healing but may not require surgery.\r\nMajor burns: Major burns are deep partial- or full-thickness burns and invariably require early surgery with skin grafting.\r\n\r\nExposure keratitis with or without secondary infection leads to conjunctival and corneal damage producing corneal opacities and, in severe cases, there may be destruction of globe.\r\nOcular surface examination:\r\nEyes should be examined under slit lamp (bio-microscopy) by an eye specialist.\r\nExamination of eyes should be done as early as possible since eyelid usually swells and shut the eyes. Most ocular thermal injuries result in superficial burns to the cornea or conjunctiva.\r\nConjunctiva: Conjunctival oedema, if present, may be due to conjunctival surface burn, mild exposure, or due to fluid resuscitation. Look for any loss of conjunctiva due to burns. Involvement of both palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva may lead to formation of symblepharon (adhesion between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva).\r\nCornea: Cornea may be examined under slit lamp after instilling fluorescein dye. Corneal injury is usually secondary to exposure, drying, and infection due to deep eyelid burns.\r\nInitial assessment should note corneal sensation in order to appraise the risk of corneal ulceration from corneal exposure. There may be corneal thinning due to lagophthalmos.\r\n\r\nSuperficial injury produces a spectrum of damage to epithelium ranging from minor punctate changes, to widespread loss of epithelium.\r\nIn severe thermal burns, there is corneal opacification associated with extensive and deep damage to the tissues and it may result in stromal scarring. The resultant eschar eventually sloughs off, leaving a thin corneal tissue which is susceptible to corneal ectasia. Direct thermal damage to the cornea produces collagen shrinkage, with prominent stress lines. Collagen damage may lead to a rapidly excavating corneal ulcer originating from liquefactive necrosis. Globe rupture is seen in extreme cases.\r\n\r\nIntraocular pressure monitoring and direct ophthalmoscopy is also required.\r\nExtent of tissue damage is a prognostic indicator of recovery following ocular surface injury. Extent of damage to corneal, limbal, conjunctival tissues and intraocular structures influences the visual outcome and may be classified as:\r\n\r\nClassification of ocular surface burns:\r\nDua (2001) provides a classification of ocular surface burns giving prognosis based on corneal appearance, conjunctival involvement and analogue scale recording the amount of limbal involvement in clock hours of affected limbus/ percentage of conjunctival involvement. The conjunctival involvement should be calculated only for the bulbar conjunctiva, up to and including the conjunctival fornices.\r\n\r\nGrade I: In Grade I, there is 0 clock hours of limbal involvement, 0% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 0/0%, and the prognosis is very good.\r\nGrade II: In Grade II, there is less than 3 clock hours of limbal involvement, less than 30% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 0.1- 3/ 1- 29.9%, and the prognosis is good.\r\nGrade III: In Grade III, there is between 3- 6 clock hours of limbal involvement, 30- 50% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 3.1- 6/ 31- 50%, and the prognosis is good.\r\nGrade IV: In Grade IV, there is between 6- 9 clock hours of limbal involvement, 50- 75% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 6.1- 9/ 51- 75%, and the prognosis is good to guarded.\r\nGrade V: In Grade V, there is between 9- 12 clock hours of limbal involvement, 75- 100% of conjunctival involvement, analogue scale reading of 9.1- 11.9/ 75- 100%, and the prognosis is guarded to poor.\r\nGrade VI: In Grade VI, there is total limbal (12 clock hours) involvement, total conjunctival (100%) involvement, analogue scale reading of 12/ 100%, and the prognosis is very poor.\r\n\r\n\r\nHughes (1946) classification (modified by Ballen in 1963, Roper- Hall in 1965 and Pfister et al in 1982) provides a prognostic guideline based on corneal appearance and extent of limbal ischaemia. The Roper-hall classification system was introduced in the mid-1960s and is the most established and commonly applied system.\r\n\r\nGrade I injury: In Grade I injury, there is corneal epithelial damage, no corneal opacity, no limbal ischaemia, and the prognosis is good.\r\nGrade II injury: In Grade II injury, the cornea is hazy but the iris details are visible. There is also ishaemia involving less than one third of the limbus and the prognosis is good.\r\nGrade III injury: In Grade III injury, there is total epithelial loss, stromal haze with obscuration of iris details, ischaemia of one third to one half of the limbus, and the prognosis is guarded.\r\nGrade IV injury: In Grade IV injury, the cornea is opaque with no view of the iris or pupil, the ischaemia is greater than one half of the limbus, and the prognosis is poor.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis:\r\n\r\nChemical injuries to the eyes.\r\nUltraviolet radiation keratitis.\r\nOther causes of corneal opacification.\r\nOcular cicatricial pemphigoid."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nThermal injuries can be devastating from both functional and psychological aspect to the patient. Complications of injuries may be minimised with prompt and adequate treatment. Barring severe and worst injuries, globe and good vision may be saved in most of the cases. Management is directed towards preserving the eye and vision, maintaining function, and restoration of cosmesis.\r\nAny co-existing systemic inhalational burn injury should be treated.\r\nManagement of eyelids:\r\nMedical therapy:\r\nImmediate management of thermal injuries requires:\r\n\r\nRemoval of any dirt and debris.\r\nGentle removal of sloughed skin.\r\nCold, moist compresses.\r\n\r\nSubsequent management:\r\n\r\nTrimming of eyelashes: Singed eyelashes in thermal eyelid burn should be trimmed to avoid the possibility of char falling in the eye causing ocular surface discomfort. Blades of scissors may be covered with an eye ointment in order to prevent cut eyelashes from falling in the eye.\r\nManagement of wound:\r\n\r\nFor mild first degree burns, cold compresses may be required in cases with significant eyelid swelling and drooping. Eyelid burns with no eyelid contraction may be treated conservatively with an antibiotic ointment.\r\nSecond- and third-degree burns with significant retraction causing lagophthalmos may require moist chamber or cellophane occlusion. If surrounding skin is severely burnt, surgical suture tarsorrhaphy may be done. Suture tarsorrhaphy is a temporary measure and may not prevent eyelid retraction. Suture tarsorrhaphy is not a substitute for eyelid repair with skin grafting.\r\nSevere third-degree burns of the eyelids may require surgical relaxing incision over the burn eschar to release the cicatrising ectropion.\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\n\r\nTemporary suture tarsorrhaphy: Temporary suture tarsorrhaphy is useful and effective in the presence of lagophthalmos caused by severe burn of the eyelid skin.\r\nSurgical tarsorrhaphy: Surgical tarsorrhaphy may be done at about two weeks when eyelid contracture usually occurs. It does not appear to prevent wound contraction where cicatricial ectropion is present. A combined lateral tarsorrhaphy with a skin graft produces good results. Since the risk of ectropion persists for months due to persistent eyelid shrinkage, a tarsorrhaphy should remain in place till the facial scar matures.\r\nMasquerade procedure: Masquerade procedure may be done to close the eye until further reconstruction, in severely damaged eyelids where no viable adjacent skin or tissue exists. All necrotic tissue including orbicularis oculi muscle and eyelid margins are excised and a conjunctival flap from the remaining upper and lower eyelid tarsal or bulbar conjunctiva is mobilised and sutured together. A split thickness skin graft is then applied to cover the entire eyelid area.\r\nSplit-thickness dermal graft: Split-thickness dermal graft is an alternative in the presence of large corneal and scleral defects which cannot be covered by conjunctival flaps. The graft may be harvested from the thigh.\r\nEyelid graft: Eyelid graft when applied in acute stage needs to be repeated several times, as a split skin graft contracts as compared to full thickness graft. If a thick skin graft is applied when all reaction to burns has subsided, one stage grafting suffices as the effect of contracting scars of adjacent tissues is minimised.\r\n\r\nIf both upper and lower eyelid requires grafting, to maximise the stretched graft bed for each eyelid, grafting is performed at separate times. The lower eyelid is operated first followed by upper eyelid.\r\nManagement of complications and sequelae of eyelids: The eyelids are evaluated at a later stage for retraction, tear pump function and cosmetic appearance.\r\n\r\nTrichiasis: Repeated electrolysis or epilation of trichiatic cilia may be required.\r\nLagophthalmos: Lagophthalmos may be corrected by lower eyelid sling procedure.\r\nMedial or lateral canthus deformities: Multiple Z plasties or local transposition flaps may be required.\r\nEyelid defects:\r\n\r\n- Eyelid defect involving up to 1/3rd of the eyelid may be closed directly.\r\n- Defects involving 1/3rd to 1/2 of the eyelid may be corrected by Tenzel\u2019s semicircular rotation flap.\r\n- Defects involving more than 1/2 of the lower eyelid may be corrected by modified Hughes procedure (tarsal-conjunctival flap).\r\n- Defects involving more than 1/2 of the upper eyelid may be corrected by sliding tarsal-conjunctival flap (variation of modified Hughes procedure).\r\n- Defects involving entire lower eyelid may be reconstructed by Mustard\u00e9 cheek rotation flap.\r\n- Large central defects of the upper eyelid may require Cutler- Beard procedure involving full thickness segment of the lower eyelid.\r\n\r\n\r\nPalpebral aperture stenosis: Cicatricial eyelid margins in full thickness eyelid burns causing palpebral aperture stenosis may require incisional release to relieve it.\r\nCanalicular obstruction: Burns around medial canthus may involve punctum and canaliculus. Daily puntal probing, punctoplasty and canaliculoplasty are the options.\r\nEyebrow deformities: Depending upon the depth of the burn, eyebrow deformities may require a full thickness composite graft of hair bearing skin from temporo-parietal region.\r\nScar revision: Scar revision with laser or surgical means may be required.\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement of ocular surface:\r\nPreparation for vision restoration: Preparation for vision restoration must begin immediately after the injury. Deliberate and timely treatment determines successful outcomes in the rehabilitative process.\r\nIn succession, management consists of emergency treatment, pressure control, suppression of inflammation, enhancing stromal repair, and establishing eyelid-globe congruity during the early days, weeks, and months after the injury.\r\nTopical or oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and topical beta blockers continue to form the mainstay of intraocular pressure control. Fibroblast inhibiting mitomycin C may improve the success of filtration surgery for glaucoma. Drainage procedures may be done if one or more filtration surgeries fail.\r\nOperative procedures for ocular surface include amniotic membrane transplant, corneal epithelial stem cell transplants, keratoplasty, large-diameter lamellar keratoplasty, and keratoprosthesis.\r\nMedical therapy:\r\nEmergency management:\r\n\r\nIrrigation of eyes: Emergency management requires prompt irrigation and the removal of residual debris from the eye. Irrigation cools the ocular surface and removes any inflammatory substance. Any available neutral irrigation solution may be used in emergency. Solutions available for irrigation include normal saline, normal saline with bicarbonate, Ringer\u2019s lactate, balanced salt solution (BSS), and BSS- plus. No therapeutic differences have been noted among these solutions. After copious irrigation, necrotic corneal epithelium should be d\u00e9brided to promote re-epithelialisation. Where possible, topical anaesthetic drops should be instilled to reduce pain and blepharospasm, thereby facilitating irrigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcute and reparative phases:\r\nAfter irrigation, better outcomes may be expected with prompt re-epithelialisation, while delayed or absent re-epithelialisation may require surgical intervention.\r\n\r\nTopical artificial tears: Topical artificial tears may be used as lubricant to the ocular surface to counter the effects of lagophthalmos.\r\nTopical antibiotics: Topical antibiotics may be used for any epithelial defects to prevent any secondary infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common gram-negative organism which may infect the affected cornea.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\nSurgical intervention that may help stabilising the ocular surface in severe thermal injury includes:\r\n\r\nTenonplasty: Tenonplasty attempts to re-establish limbal vascularity in severe injuries and to promote re- epithelialisation. In this, all necrotic conjunctival and episcleral tissues are excised. Tenon\u2019s capsule is dissected with blunt instrument, and the resultant flap with its preserved blood supply is advanced to the limbus.\r\nTissue adhesives (tissue glue): Tissue adhesives preserve integrity in the event of corneal thinning with impending or actual perforation of the globe. This is usually accompanied by the application of a soft bandage contact lens, which prevents glue dislodgement. Tissue glue can stop further melting by excluding inflammatory cells and their mediators. Tissue adhesives also provide a means of delaying penetrating keratoplasty.\r\nAmniotic membrane transplantation: Amniotic membrane transplantation may be used as supplement to surgical procedures where coverage of raw surfaces or suppression of inflammation is required. Amniotic membrane has anti-angiogenic (inhibitors of blood vessels growth) and anti-inflammatory proteins capable of suppressing the inflammatory response. Amniotic membrane can create a new basement membrane and promote epithelial healing. Amniotic membrane might be applied after a thermal injury following emergency services, usually weeks later. Despite benefits, amniotic membrane cannot replace the need for corneal stem cells.\r\nCorneal stem cell transplantation: Replacement of the corneal stem cells lost due to injury is important in restoration of an intact and normal corneal epithelial cell layer. These primitive, slow-cycling stem cells are located in the limbal area.\r\n\r\nMonocular injuries allow for procurement of stem cells from the uninjured eye. When the injury is bilateral, Pfister (1993) showed that allografted limbal tissue was capable of restoring the stem cell population from an unrelated donor. Allografted corneal stem cells must be protected from the recipient immune process by systemic immune-suppression e.g. with cyclosporine.\r\n\r\nCorneal transplantation (Keratoplasty):\r\n\r\n       Success in restorative corneal surgery is governed by:\r\n- Lid-globe congruity with normal blinking and the absence of corneal exposure. Preparatory procedures to lyse symblepharon, expand cul-de-sacs, and to eliminate lagophthalmos are often required to re-establish normal lid functioning.\r\n- Quality and quantity of tear film.\r\n- The presence of epithelial stem cells phenotypic for cornea.\r\n- The absence of any current ulceration, inflammation, and/or uncontrolled glaucoma. Secondary glaucoma must also be controlled with medications or filtration surgery.\r\n- Flawless surgical technique.\r\n- Fresh corneal transplant tissue.\r\nThe value of preoperative use of LASER for blood vessels at the limbus in high-risk patients is controversial, but at least it reduces bleeding at the time of surgery.\r\nIf corneal surgery is delayed 18 months to 2 years after a burn, it increases the chances of success, especially in the absence of pre-existing ulceration, perforation, or glaucoma.\r\nPenetrating keratoplasty: Penetrating keratoplasty refers to the full- thickness replacement of the affected cornea with a healthy donor. Penetrating keratoplasty may be used to provide tectonic support (such as in corneal thinning and perforation), and to improve visual outcome (such as in the replacement of corneal scarring).\r\nLarge-diameter penetrating keratoplasty: Replacement of the entire cornea and adjacent stem cells by large-diameter penetrating keratoplasty may be performed. One potential danger might be that such large transplants might interfere with the trabecular outflow channels and hence increase the likelihood of glaucoma. Proximity to the limbal blood vessels makes an immune rejection more likely.\r\nLarge-diameter lamellar keratoplasty: A very promising technique in corneal transplantation for injuries includes the use of 12 or 13 mm lamellar corneal transplants, along with the limbal epithelial stem cell population. Smaller lamellar transplants are useful to fill in deep corneal ulcerations, descemetoceles, or frank corneal perforations.\r\n\r\nKeratoprosthesis (Artificial cornea): In the most severe cases, implantation of a keratoprosthesis (e.g. Boston keratoprosthesis) might afford the only means by which vision can be restored.\r\n\r\nIndications for keratoprosthesis are:\r\n- Corneas exhibiting exuberant vascularity.\r\n- Repeated failures of fresh transplanted corneal tissue.\r\n- Chronic limbal stem cell deficiency.\r\n- Inability to restore normal lid anatomy.\r\nThe operation is usually advised in patients with severe bilateral injuries where serviceable vision is not present in either eye. A surprising degree of success may be achieved with keratoprosthesis. Critical to the visual outcome of a keratoprosthesis is the control of intraocular pressure at all times after the injury. Complications of keratoprosthesis include corneal melt, infection, glaucoma and formation of retro-prosthetic membrane.\r\n\r\nConjunctival transplantation: Conjunctival transplantation is a means of restoring conjunctival fornices following fibrosis. This provides compatible tissue with a basement membrane, unlike other mucosal replacements. The procedure involves taking a sample of upper bulbar conjunctiva from the contra-lateral (other uninvolved) eye.\r\nBuccal and Nasal mucosa transplant: Buccal mucosa grafts may be used to treat symblepharon (adhesion between bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva), trichiasis (misdirected eyelashes), distichiasis (partial or complete second row of eyelashes), or entropion. The graft is usually obtained from the posterior aspect of the upper or lower lip. The advantage of nasal mucosal grafts lies in the ability to obtain large sized grafts.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nThe prognosis for severe injury is typically poor and may result in widespread damage to the ocular surface epithelium, cornea and anterior segment. However, in recent years, the prognosis of severe ocular burns has improved, with advances in the understanding of the physiology of the cornea and the resultant development of enhanced medical and surgical treatments. The final visual prognosis is influenced by:\r\n\r\nThe extent of ocular damage.\r\nThe timing and efficacy of treatment."

                "Terrien\u2019s Marginal Degeneration (TMD) is a slowly progressive, bilateral, peripheral corneal thinning disorder associated with corneal neovascularisation, opacification and lipid deposition. The disease is usually bilateral but may initially present in one eye. The cause of Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration is not known and patients may have high degrees of astigmatism. Up to about one third of patients may have associated episcleral or scleral inflammation. Patients are typically between 20-40 years of age, although it may present in childhood or in older people (age ranges from 10 to 70 years). It is more common in men than in women.\r\nTerrien (1900) first described this disorder. The condition is usually bilateral and starts in the superonasal quadrant as a fine, yellow- white punctate stromal opacity that may progress along the circumference of the cornea.\r\nTwo types of Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration have been documented. One type occurs primarily in the older population. It is usually asymptomatic and slowly progressive. The other, more inflammatory type characteristically occurs in younger patients and may be associated with episcleritis or scleritis. It has also been reported in patients with posterior polymorphous dystrophy, anterior basement membrane dystrophy, and erythema elevatum diutinum (rare chronic dermatosis).\r\nMarked astigmatism may be corrected initially with spectacle or contact lenses. Surgical intervention may be required to correct visually disabling astigmatism, prevent impending perforation, and to treat corneal perforation."

                "The diagnosis of Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration is clinical, based on history, slit lamp (bio-microscopy) examination of the eye, and corneal topography.\r\nThe disease process is extremely slow, often taking 30 years. Patients give history of progressive change of glasses with slowly deteriorating vision from severe against-the-rule astigmatism (caused by progressive flattening of the vertical meridian).\r\nClinical signs:\r\nTerrien\u2019s marginal degeneration usually begins superonasally with peripheral, fine, yellow-white punctate stromal opacities. A lucid zone of clear cornea separates the opacities from the limbus. In due course, the opacities coalesce into a line similar to arcus senilis, superficial vessels advances from the limbus, with thinning of the intervening stroma. The thinning slowly spreads circumferentially and rarely towards the center as well. In advanced stages, localised areas of ectasia develop along the course of corneal thinning. Circumferential ectasia is rare. Epithelium is intact throughout the course of the disease.\r\nSpontaneous breaks in Descemet\u2019s membrane resulting in corneal hydrops have been reported. Corneal hydrops presents as a clear intracorneal pocket of aqueous rather than stromal clouding. Since Bowman\u2019s membrane remains intact, there is corneal intra-lamellar dissection and formation of corneal cysts. Occasionally, intracorneal aqueous pockets become continuous with subconjunctival space with formation of filtering blebs and resultant hypotony. Perforation either spontaneous or following minor trauma may occur, but is rare.\r\nPseudo-pterygium may develop rarely in some patients with Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration. The pseudo-pterygium characteristically occurs in positions other than interpalpebral 3 o\u2019clock and 9 o\u2019clock position and grows onto the cornea at an oblique angle. This variant may be the same as Fuch\u2019s superficial marginal keratitis.\r\nOccasionally, Terrien\u2019s may present with recurrent painful episodes of inflammation. Collagen vascular disease should be ruled out.\r\nSalient features are:\r\n\r\nHigh against-the-rule or oblique astigmatism.\r\nLeading edge of lipid.\r\nSteep central edge.\r\nSloping peripheral edge.\r\nSuperficial vascularisation.\r\nIntact epithelium.\r\n\r\n\r\nTerrien\u2019s marginal degeneration is distinguished from other peripheral corneal thinning disorders by:\r\n\r\nLack of inflammation.\r\nPresence of superficial vascularisation.\r\nAdvancing linear deposition of lipid.\r\nLack of epithelial defect. \r\nSlow progressive course.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorneal topography/ Videokeratography: Corneal topography/ Videokeratography measures corneal curvature, elevation and the amount of corneal astigmatism. This also helps in fitting rigid gas permeable contact lenses. Corneal topography reveals flattening over the peripheral areas of corneal thinning. It shows steepening opposite to the mid-point of corneal thinning.\r\nScanning slit topography: Scanning slit topography utilises optical slits that scan along multiple points of the cornea. This allows for measurements of the anterior and posterior cornea including pachymetry (measures corneal thickness).\r\nUltrasound biomicroscopy: Ultrasound biomicroscopy quantifies the thickness of the cornea and help to detect progression of disease. Due to its high magnification and ability to depict the size and shape of structures, it can reveal subtle changes in the cornea.\r\n\r\nHistopathology:\r\nThe epithelium may be normal, thickened, or thinned. Basal epithelial cells show degeneration. Bowman\u2019s membrane and anterior stromal lamella are lost and replaced by vascularised loose connective tissue. Limbal vessels advance centrally within the superficial connective tissue, loop at the central margin of furrow, and revert back to the limbus passing just anterior to Descemet\u2019s layer.\r\nThe remaining stromal lamella is compressed and shows lipid deposition. Lipid deposition is most prominent anterior to the vascular arcades. Histiocytes line the blood vessels and contain phagocytosed lipid, corneal collagen, and ground substance. Tear fluid contains higher levels of lysosomal enzymes.\r\nDescemet\u2019s membrane is usually intact and may be thickened or thinned. However, reports also describe presence of healed ruptures of Descemet\u2019s membrane. The endothelium is intact and is either normal or attenuated.\r\nDifferential diagnosis:\r\n\r\nMooren\u2019s Ulcer:\r\n\r\n-Active Mooren\u2019s ulcer: Active Mooren\u2019s ulcer is usually associated with pain and conjunctival inflammation, whereas Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration is usually painless and uninflamed. Mooren\u2019s ulcer may have inflammatory infiltrate and an overhanging central edge, usually with an epithelial defect. There is no lipid deposition. Ulceration involves anterior one- third of the cornea and usually spreads rapidly, both circumferentially and centrally with infiltration and vascularisation at the leading edge. An autoimmune trigger or a history of insult or trauma to the cornea may be the causative factor for Mooren\u2019s ulcer. Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration shows a gradually sloping central edge with intact epithelium and it shows lipid deposition. Terrien\u2019s, probably a degenerative process, progresses slowly and circumferentially. Peripheral cornea may be vascularised in both conditions.\r\n- Healed Mooren\u2019s ulcer: Healed Mooren\u2019s ulcer is a common disease mimicking Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration. Both diseases lack systemic findings. Mooren\u2019s ulcer may be bilateral or unilateral, whereas Terrien\u2019s is usually bilateral.\r\n\r\nPellucid marginal degeneration: Peripheral corneal thinning associated with pellucid marginal degeneration is inferior and lacks lipid deposition and vascularisation. It is usually bilateral but may be asymmetric. Onset occurs during fourth and fifth decades of life. There is a slowly progressive 1- 2mm band of inferior thinning leaving 1- 2mm margin from the limbus. It presents with an area of steepening superior to the area of corneal thinning.\r\nKeratoconus: Keratoconus is a progressive stromal thinning occurring centrally or paracentrally. It is bilateral, but may be asymmetric, and begins around puberty. Retinoscopy shows scissoring reflex. Slit lamp (bio- microscopy) may reveal Vogt striae (vertical stress lines in deep stroma) or epithelial Fleischer ring (iron deposit at the base of the cone). Keratoconus patients have progressive myopia, irregular astigmatism with steep keratometry readings. Munson\u2019s sign, which is bulging of lower lid on down- gaze, may also be present. Rizutti\u2019s sign is an arrowhead pattern at the nasal limbus being produced by focusing of a light beam shown from temporal side across the cornea in keratoconus. Severe cases may develop acute hydrops (stromal oedema due to leakage of aqueous humour through breaks in Descemet\u2019s membrane).\r\nFurrow or gutter degeneration: Furrow or gutter degeneration lacks vascularisation.\r\nCollagen vascular diseases: Corneal thinning in collagen vascular diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis and polyarteritis nodosa is usually associated with systemic findings.\r\nArcus senilis: Arcus senilis may mimic peripheral opacification associated with early stages of Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration. Arcus senilis is characterised by both superior and inferior peripheral corneal opacification, absence of vascularisation, and lack of corneal thinning. It progresses circumferentially to form a band about 1mm wide in perilimbal cornea. The peripheral edge is sharp and separated from the limbus by a clear zone.\r\nVernal keratoconjunctivitis: Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is a recurrent bilateral condition presenting with itching, photophobia, foreign body sensation and mucous discharge. It affects palpebral conjunctiva, limbal area of the cornea or both. It produces giant papillae in superior palpebral conjunctiva and/or limbal papillae with a white apex called Horner-Trantas dots. Corneal changes such as punctate epithelial erosions, macro-erosions and shield ulcers may also occur.\r\nOcular rosacea: Rosacea is an idiopathic skin condition affecting sun- exposed areas. Clinical features include facial flushing, papulopustular rash and thickening of skin that may evolve into rhinophyma (swollen enlarged nose). Ocular symptoms include irritation, watering and burning. The lids may show superficial telangiectasias and blepharitis. There may be conjunctival hyperaemia. Cornea may develop punctate epithelial erosions, marginal keratitis, corneal vascularisation or scarring.\r\nStaphylococcal marginal keratitis: Staphylococcal marginal keratitis lesions usually have a lucid interval (separated from the limbus by a clear zone) between the limbus and the infiltrate and only rarely cause thinning."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nUsually no treatment is required, unless perforation or impending perforation occurs. However, spectacles and rigid gas permeable lenses are prescribed for refractive errors.\r\nMedical therapy:\r\n\r\nSpectacle correction: To begin with in the early mild cases of the disease, spectacle correction is prescribed. Patients with high astigmatism may be prescribed with high refractive index sphero-cylindrical glasses. Due to the risk of corneal perforation in the area of TMD, polycarbonate lenses are recommended. Polycarbonate lenses are light weight and impact resistant.\r\nRigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses: Rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses may be required for cases of TMD. Piggyback rigid gas permeable contact lenses may be used. In piggyback, a soft contact lens is worn under the gas permeable lens, acting as a cushion to reduce or eliminate any discomfort caused by the gas- permeable lens. It is recommended that patients wear plano polycarbonate glasses over their contact lens prescription to avoid any risk of corneal perforation due to thinning.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy: \r\n\r\nKeratoplasty: Keratoplasty is considered for patients with TMD whose vision is inadequate with contact lenses or for patients who are intolerant to lens. Reconstructive keratoplasty is performed when thinning becomes so severe that corneal perforation is threatened or it occurs.\r\n\r\nPenetrating keratoplasty: In general, patients with TMD are usually poor candidates for penetrating keratoplasty as the corneal thinning occurs close to the limbus. As a result, large eccentric grafts are required and must be positioned very close to the limbus thus increasing the chances of graft rejection or suture-induced complications.\r\nLamellar crescentic keratoplasty: In lamellar crescentic keratoplasty, crescent-shaped donor lamellar (partial thickness) cornea is used.\r\nFull- thickness crescentic keratoplasty: In Full- thickness crescentic keratoplasty, thinned cornea is removed entirely and the Descemet\u2019s membrane of the donor is retained.\r\nAnnular lamellar keratoplasty: Annular lamellar keratoplasty grafts may be required in severe cases of Terrien\u2019s marginal degeneration, involving complete 360\u02da.\r\nLamellar keratoplasties are often preferred over penetrating keratoplasty because of the decreased risk of graft rejection, corneal opacification and development of irregular astigmatism.\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nMost patients with no impending perforation may be managed successfully with glasses or rigid gas- permeable contact lenses. Because there is typically no epithelial defect, the risk of infectious keratitis and acute corneal thinning is low. However, these patients require regular monitoring."

Humans can get infected with two species of tapeworms-Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) and Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm). T.saginata has no major impact on human health while T. solium leads to neurocysticercosis-most severe form of the disease.\r\nNeurocysticercosis is a common cause of seizures; and the most frequent preventable cause of epilepsy worldwide. According to World Health Organization (WHO) 30% of all epilepsy cases in endemic countries and 3% epileptic cases globally may be due to neurocysticercosis.\r\nTaeniasis/cysticercosis mainly affects the people in developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Taeniasis and (neuro)cysticercosis are common in areas where animal husbandry practices are such that pigs and cattle come into contact with human faeces. But imported taeniasis can also lead to cases in the population of countries whereT.solium is not considered a public health problem. \r\nThe disease is prevalent in all states of India, although the prevalence varies between the states. The National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore reported neurocysticercosis (NCC) in 2% of unselected series of epilepsy patients. In a study from New Delhi, NCC accounted for 2.5% of all intracranial space occupying lesions. An unusual feature of the disease was seen that more than 95% of Indian patients with NCC are vegetarians.\r\nCysticercosis is highly prevalent in the northern States of Bihar, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. In a rural pig farming community of Mohanlalganj block, Lucknow district, Uttar Pradesh, the prevalence of taeniasis was found to be 18.6%.In the same community, active epilepsy was confirmed in 5.8% of the populations and 48.3% of people with epilepsy fulfilled either definitive or probable diagnostic criteria for NCC.\r\nHumans become infected after consuming raw or undercooked, infected meat, or food and water contaminated with tapeworm eggs, or through poor hygiene practices. When T.solium larvae invade body tissues, a more serious condition known as cysticercosis develops. When larvae invade the central nervous system, muscles, skin and eyes, it leads to neurocysticercosis.\r\nNeurocysticercosis is an important and preventable cause of epilepsy which creates burden through stigmatization, incapacitation and loss of work productivity. In Southeast Asia T. solium taeniasis/cystcercosis is considered one of the major neglected tropical diseases by WHO as these have not been given enough importance at national or international levels."

Size and shape of hyphaema is recorded daily, so as to assess its resolution or secondary haemorrhage, if it occurs. Daily assessment of visual acuity and pupillary reactions help in assessment of progress of medical management. Applanation tonometry to record intraocular pressure is deferred, unless elevated intraocular pressure is suspected. Fundus examination is also postponed till the media is clear, barring few exceptions.

                "There is diversity of opinion regarding how to manage patients with traumatic hyphaema. Proper information of the current status and serious nature of injury to eye is the first step of management.\r\n\r\nSupportive therapy:\r\nElevation of head of patient helps in settling of the hyphaema due to gravity. This may help in clearing the visual axis to improve the vision and allow fundus examination. Eye patching with metal shield protects the eye.\r\nInpatient care of patient has been the standard care for many years. It helps in easy monitoring and administration of medicines.\r\nSome recent studies have shown comparable outcomes with outpatient daily visits. Outpatient visit is preferred by patient and their family and is recommended in compliant patients.\r\nInpatient management is still advisable for patients who are at increased risk of secondary bleeding, glaucoma or possible noncompliance.\r\n\r\nMedical therapy:\r\n\r\nAnti-glaucoma drugs: Elevated intraocular pressure is common after injury to eye and may lead to corneal blood staining. Drugs like topical beta-adrenergic antagonists are usually the first choice. Hyperosmotic agents and topical/systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may also be used. Patients with sickle cell anaemia require intensive treatment because sickle cells can block the angle of anterior chamber. This may lead to elevation of intraocular pressure.\r\nCorticosteroids: Corticosteroids may reduce the risk of secondary haemorrhage by inhibiting fibrinolysis and stabilising blood-ocular barrier. Topical corticosteroids have shown to reduce intraocular inflammation and may prevent re-bleeding. It reduces iritis and prevent formation of posterior synechia in adults.\r\nAntifibrinolytics: To reduce re-bleeding, topical and systemic antifibrinolytics such as tranexamic acid may be used. These inhibit fibrinolysis and stabilise blood clot.\r\n\r\nTopical cycloplegic agents are useful in patients with significant ciliary spasm or photophobia.\r\n\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\nMedical therapy is preferable for initial four days if rise in intraocular pressure is well controlled and there is no blood staining of cornea. Surgical evacuation of blood may be required in certain group of cases.\r\nIndications for surgical evacuation of blood clot in hyphaema:\r\nElevated intraocular pressure (IOP), unresponsive to medical therapy:\r\n\r\nIOP &gt; 50 mm of Hg for 5 days.\r\nIOP &gt; 35 mm of Hg for 7 days.\r\nIOP &gt; 25 mm of Hg for 1 day in patients with sickle cell disease or trait or pre-existing glaucoma.\r\n\r\nCorneal blood staining:\r\n\r\nAt the first sign of blood staining, regardless of IOP or grade of hyphaema.\r\nIOP &gt; 25 and total hyphaema to prevent blood staining.\r\n\r\nProlonged duration of clot:\r\n\r\nPersistent total hyphaema &gt; 5 days.\r\nPersistent small hyphaema &gt; 10 days.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nPrognosis for recovery of vision is related to damage to other ocular structures, development of glaucoma, corneal blood staining, re-bleeding and optic atrophy. Patients with traumatic hyphaema requires follow up for assessment of development of any complications."

                "Diagnosis depends upon the clinical features and the clinical tests.\r\nTrochlear nerve palsy typically produces diplopia, which is worse in downgaze. Because of diplopia in downgaze, patients tend to close one eye while reading.\r\nSome cases reveal limited downgaze in adducted position. However, ocular movements are grossly normal in most of the cases.\r\nIpsilateral head tilting increases vertical strabismus, and thus, diplopia. Therefore, patients tilt their head on the opposite side to avoid diplopia.\r\n\r\nTests:\r\n\r\nCover-uncover test: Cover-uncover test demonstrate hypertropia which worsens in contralateral gaze.\r\nMaddox rod test: Like Cover-uncover test, Maddox rod test also demonstrate hypertropia, which worsens in contralateral gaze.\r\nParks-Bielschowsky 3-step test: Parks-Bielschowsky 3-step test identify patterns of ocular motility conforming to dysfunction of specific vertically acting extraocular muscle of the eye. The three steps are:\r\n\r\nStep 1: Find the side of hypertropia in the primary gaze. For example, if the right eye is higher, the weakness lies either in the muscles depressing right eye (right superior oblique muscle and right inferior rectus muscle) or in the elevators of left eye (left superior rectus muscle and left inferior oblique muscle).\r\nStep 2: Determine which gaze, left or right, the hypertropia is more. If the right eye deviates most when the head is turned to the right (both eyes turn to the left), then only right superior oblique muscle or left superior rectus muscle is affected.\r\nStep 3: Determine which side the head tilt, left or right, the hypertropia is more. This test relies on the torsional balancing reflexes provoked by head tilt. The higher eye extorts (because of inferior oblique muscle), while the lower eye intorts (because of superior oblique muscle).\r\nSince superior oblique muscle is by far most commonly responsible for vertical diplopia, a head tilt to the same side as the involved muscle exacerbates it. The eye that is highest in adduction looks at the affected muscle.\r\n\r\nBilateral trochlear nerve palsy should be considered as well, whenever unilateral palsy is diagnosed, especially following head injury.\r\nBilateral trochlear nerve palsy presents with\r\n\r\nCrossed hypertropia. Right eye is higher in left gaze and the left eye is higher in right gaze\r\nExcyclotorsion of 10\u00b0 or more. Each eye is rotated outwards\r\nThere is large V pattern of strabismus\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, a fourth step, is also useful. The fourth step determines whether the vertical separation is greater in downgaze or upgaze, and also check for relative cyclotropia.\r\n\r\nImaging:\r\n\r\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): MRI may identify lesions affecting brain parenchyma or brainstem. It may identify lesions like brain tumour or ischaemia.\r\nCT scanning: CT scanning may detect presence of any calcification or aneurysm.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis\r\nTrochlear nerve palsy may be differentiated from conditions like\r\n\r\nMyasthenia gravis\r\nThyroid eye disease\r\nBrown syndrome: It is characterised by restriction of superior oblique trochlea-tendon complex, so that affected eye does not elevate in adduction"

                "Dentinal Hypersensitivity is commonly known as tooth sensitivity. If a person feels mild to severe discomfort or pain on consuming hot, cold, or sweet food and drinks or breathing in cold air, it indicates sensitive teeth. It is a very common clinical presentation and causes considerable concern for patients. Studies showed that in most populations, 10-30% of the general population suffer from dentinal hypersensitivity.\r\nDEFINITION\r\nDentine hypersensitivity (DH) is defined as short, sharp pain arising from exposed dentine, typically in response to chemical, thermal or osmotic stimuli that cannot be explained as arising from any other forms of dental defect or pathology. \r\n-(Addy &amp; Dowell, 1983)\r\nIt is common in people of age 20 - 40 years, with the peak incidence occurring at the end of the third decade and decreases during the fourth and fifth decades of life. Women are affected more than men.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\nhttps://www.ida.org.in/Public/Details/SensitiveTeeth\r\nhttps://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/az-topics/s/sensitive-teeth\r\nhttps://www.dentalhealth.org/sensitive-teeth"

                "The tooth has outer enamel layer that protects the dentin underneath. The dentin comprises of microscopic tubules or canals that are connected to the pulp of the tooth. If dentin loses its protective covering of enamel its tubules get exposed. These tubules allow heat, cold or acidic foods to reach the nerves and cells inside the pulp of the tooth and the tooth becomes sensitive.\r\n\r\nToothbrush abrasion: Brushing too hard, and brushing from side to side, causes enamel wear, making freshly exposed dentine sensitive.\r\n\r\nDental erosion:It is loss of tooth enamel due to attacks of acid from acidic food and drinks. If enamel is worn away, the dentine underneath is exposed which may lead to sensitivity.\r\n\r\nGum disease: A build-up of plaque or tartar can cause the gum to recede down the tooth and even destroy the bony support of the tooth. Due to receded gums, roots of the teeth get exposed and become more sensitive. Pockets can form in the gums around the tooth, making the area difficult to keep clean and the problem worsen.\r\n\r\nTooth grinding: A habit which involves clenching and grinding of the teeth. This also causes the teeth enamel to be worn away, making the teeth sensitive.\r\n\r\nAcracked toothor filling: a cracked tooth/filling is the one that has broken.\r\n\r\nTooth bleaching: some patients have sensitivity for a short time during bleaching or after bleaching\r\n\r\nSeveral theories have been proposed to explain the mechanism involved in dentinal hypersensitivity such as the transducer theory, the modulation theory, the \u201cgate\u201d control and vibration theory, and the hydrodynamic theory.\r\nThe most widely accepted theory is Brannstrom\u2019s hydrodynamic theory, that is fluid movement within the dentinal tubules.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES:\r\nhttps://www.ida.org.in/Public/Details/SensitiveTeeth\r\nhttps://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/az-topics/s/sensitive-teeth\r\nhttps://www.dentalhealth.org/sensitive-teeth"

Besides being a cosmetic problem, varicose veins can be painful, especially when standing. Severe long-standing varicose veins can lead to leg swelling, venous eczema, skin thickening and ulceration.

However, it is important to have vitamin B12 in the diet to ensure the store is kept at a healthy level.\r\nConditions affecting the stomach- Some stomach conditions or stomach operations can also prevent the absorption of vitamin B12. For example, a gastrectomy(a surgical procedure where part of stomach is removed) also increases risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency anemia.\r\nConditions affecting the intestines- Some conditions that affect intestines (part of the digestive system). For example, Crohn\u2019s disease (a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system) can sometimes result in body not able to absorb enough vitamin B12.\r\n\r\nFolate deficiency anaemia\r\nFolate is a water-soluble vitamin (it dissolves in water), as a result body is unable to store it for long periods of time. Body stores folate that last four months. This means one need folate in daily diet to ensure body has sufficient stores of the vitamin.\r\n\r\nDiet- Not having enough folate in daily diet.\r\nMal absorption- Sometimes body is unable to absorb folate as effectively as it should. This is usually the result of an underlying condition affecting digestive system, such as Coeliac disease.\r\nExcessive urination- Body may lose folate from body if one urinate frequently. This can be caused by an underlying condition that affects one of the organs, such as your kidneys or liver.\r\nPregnancy- If a women is pregnant or planning to get pregnant, daily supplement of 0.4mg of folic acid should be taken for at least 12 weeks."

VKC usually begins before the age of 10 years. It generally resolves around puberty, usually about 4-10 years after onset and only rarely may persist beyond the age of 25 years.\r\nIt is more common in males than in females. The male preponderance is prominent below 20 years of age but thereafter, male and female ratio of involvement becomes almost equal.\r\nThe exact aetiology and pathogenesis is still unclear, although allergic nature of this disease is being accepted for long. Role of genetic predisposition and environmental factors in onset, progression and resolution of this self-limiting disease, but incapacitating at times, is not clear. Occurrence of this disease is not limited to spring, with episodes of reactivity being quite common in winter. Initial seasonal feature turn into perennial (occurring throughout the year) disease after few years.\r\nPatients may have associated atopy (genetic tendency to develop allergic disease) or have a close family history of atopy. Atopic patients often develop asthma, eczema and seasonal allergic rhinitis during infancy.\r\nAlthough this is not usually a blinding disease, visual impairment may occur if there is corneal involvement.\r\nPatients with VKC have an increased incidence of keratoconus.\r\nThree main clinical types are:-\r\n- Palpebral (Eyelid).\r\n- Limbal (junction between conjunctiva and cornea). \r\n- Mixed.\r\nVernal keratoconjunctivitis has a wide geographical distribution and young people in dry and hot climates are primarily affected."

                "Diagnosis of VKC is based upon typical clinical features, thus many mild or atypical cases may escape diagnosis. Lack of standardised diagnostic criteria regarding the severity of VKC renders this disease more difficult to diagnose and manage.\r\nDespite facts suggesting immune responses in the pathogenesis of VKC, no clinical or laboratory test has evolved to support the diagnosis in atypical cases or predict the course of disease.\r\nHistory of atopy in patient or the family, elevated serum level of total and specific IgE, higher number of eosinophils and mast cells, increased level of mediators and favourable response to anti-allergic therapy is observed in VKC.\r\nPrevalence of IgE sensitisation is found to be significantly lesser in bulbar as compared to palpebral and mixed type of VKC.\r\n\r\nClinical features:\r\nSigns of VKC are mostly confined to conjunctiva and cornea.\r\nPalpebral VKC:\r\n- Giant papillae: Classic conjunctival sign in palpebral VKC is the presence of giant papillae. The bluish-white papillae are separated by white connective tissue septa. Papillae, most commonly, occur on superior palpebral conjunctiva, and on rupture of connective tissue septa forms giant papillae. Inferior palpebral conjunctiva is unaffected. Giant papillae assume a flat-top appearance, which is described as \u2018cobblestone papillae\u2019. Active disease is characterised by redness, swelling and tightly packed papillae. As the inflammation settles, the papillae become more separated.\r\n- Mucous discharge: A ropy mucous discharge may be present, which commonly is associated with palpebral papillae. Large numbers of eosinophils are present in discharge, indicating presence of extended periods of inflammation.\r\n- Vascular abnormalities.\r\n- Follicles.\r\n- Sub-conjunctival scarring.\r\n- Conjunctival inclusion cysts.\r\n- Entropion.\r\n- Mechanical ptosis (drooping of upper eyelids): Large papillae may cause mechanical ptosis.\r\nBulbar VKC:\r\nBulbar VKC commonly occurs in dark-skinned individuals.\r\n- Papillae: Multiple, small, nodule-like papillae occur at the limbus (junction between cornea and conjunctiva), mostly at the upper part and have a thick gelatinous appearance.\r\n- Horner-Trantas dots: Horner-Trantas dots (collections of degenerated epithelial cells and eosinophils) appear as multiple yellow-white spots at the apices of limbal papillae. Horner-Trantas dots rarely last longer than a week from their initial presentation.\r\n- Micropannus: Micropannus is a superficial fibrovascular proliferation that extends 1-2 mm beyond normal vascular arcade. Micropannus may develop, more commonly, around upper limbus. (Roy Frederick Hampton, Fraunfelder Frederick W., Fraunfelder Frederick T., Roy and Fraunfelder's Current Ocular Therapy. Sixth Edition. Saunders Elsevier. 2008. P.366.)\r\n- Chronic limbitis (inflammation): Chronic limbitis, more common in black patients, is characterised by hyperaemic, oedematous and thickened conjunctiva. In severe cases, chronic limbitis may cause 360 degrees limbal cell deficiency.\r\n- Peri-limbal conjunctival pigmentation: Patients may develop typical peri-limbal conjunctival pigmentation. Extent of pigmentation does not correlate with the severity of symptoms and signs of VKC. Pigment may persist when the disease becomes inactive.\r\n\r\nMixed VKC: \r\nMixed VKC shows features of both palpebral and bulbar forms.\r\nCorneal features:\r\nWhile corneal vascularisation is rare (late corneal vascularisation may take place), cornea may be affected in a variety of ways, such as:\r\n- Punctate epithelial keratopathy (PEK): Punctate epithelial keratopathy (PEK) may result from toxic effect of inflammatory mediators. PEK can coalesce, resulting in frank epithelial erosion or shield ulcer.\r\n- Epithelial erosions: PEK may coalesce and form epithelial erosions.\r\n- Shield Ulcer: Shield ulcers are oval-shaped epithelial defects and usually have their lower border in upper half of visual axis. Pathogenesis of shield ulcer is not well understood, major factor for its development may be chronic mechanical irritation from giant palpebral papillae. Healed shield ulcers may leave a sub-epithelial ring-like scar.\r\n- Vernal pseudogerontoxon: Vernal pseudogerontoxon, with appearance of \u2018Cupid\u2019s Bow\u2019 (outline in a previously inflamed segment of the limbus), is a degenerative lesion in peripheral cornea resembling arcus (white ring in periphery of cornea) senilis. Pseudogerontoxon is a waxing and waning grey-white lipid deposition in superficial stroma of peripheral cornea.\r\n- Plaque formation: Plaque is usually caused by epithelial erosions in which the bare area becomes coated with fibrin and layers of desiccated mucus. Plaque resists wetting by tears and re-epithelialisation. New vessel growth may occur in plaque.\r\n- Sub-epithelial scarring: Sub-epithelial scarring, usually in the form of a ring, is a sign of previous severe corneal involvement.\r\n- Keratoconus: Keratoconus may be seen in chronic cases, which may be associated with chronic eye rubbing.\r\nThe skin of the eyelid and eyelid margin is relatively uninvolved. Conjunctiva of the fornices (junction between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) usually does not show shortening and symblepharon (adhesion between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) formation is uncommon. Iritis (inflammation of iris) is not reported in VKC.\r\nNo precise diagnostic criteria, is established for VKC. Hyperaemia, itching, watering, photophobia and thick mucoid discharge are typical features of VKC. Large papillae on upper palpebral conjunctiva and corneo-scleral junction are hallmarks of VKC.\r\n\r\nHistopathology and immunohistochemistry:\r\nHistopathology of conjunctival tissue shows a prominent inflammatory cellular infiltration in epithelium and substantia propria and post-inflammatory tissue remodelling. Tissue remodelling is more marked in palpebral rather than bulbar conjunctiva.\r\nTissue inflammation:\r\nTissue inflammation in chronic cases shows cellular infiltration of both stroma and epithelium, particularly in specimens taken from limbus. Cellular infiltrates consist of eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, macrophages, plasma cells and B-lymphocytes, frequently organised as small lymphoid follicles without germinal center. Eosinophils are characteristic constituents of cellular infiltrates.\r\nIn palpebral conjunctiva, stromal infiltrate consists of diffuse T-lymphocyte reaction with clustering of B-lymphocytes, eosinophils, plasma cells and mast cells.\r\nTissue remodelling:\r\nOvergrowth of conjunctival connective tissue, with formation of large and sessile papillae on upper palpebral conjunctiva, is one of the most notable finding. Conjunctival thickening, subepithelial fibrosis, neovascularisation and scarring are typical in chronic cases. Epithelial changes, connective tissue deposition, cellular infiltration, oedema and glandular hypertrophy contribute in tissue remodelling.\r\nOn histological examination, number of goblet cells is increased in giant papillae and epithelial in-growth. Epithelial in-growth in stroma is rich in goblet cells and may give pseudo-glandular appearance. Collagen fibers in palpebral giant papilla are thicker, increased and irregularly arranged. A proliferation of capillaries and neo-vascular formations provide vascular support to the papillae. Various growth factors are increased in VKC as compared to normal subjects.\r\n\r\nMediators in VKC:\r\nNumber of mediators and cytokines in chronic inflammatory VKC occur on ocular surface:\r\n- Cytokines: Cytokines are small secreted proteins that mediate and regulate immunity and inflammation. These are not stored in body, but have to be produced in response to a stimulus.\r\n- Chemokines: Chemokines are multi-potent cytokines which localise and enhance inflammation by inducing chemotaxis and cell activation of different inflammatory cells present at sites of inflammation.\r\n- Histamine: Histamine is an important inflammatory mediator in allergic eye disease and is released by activated mast cells and basophils. Skin test reactivity to histamine shows a greater wheal and flare response in patients with VKC, suggesting hypersensitivity. Histamine causes pruritus (itching), hyperaemia and participates in allergic inflammation and tissue remodelling by altering behaviour of conjuctival epithelium and fibroblasts.\r\n- Metalloproteinases (MMPs): Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are extracellular endopeptidases that selectively degrade components of extracellular matrix. Increased production and activation of MMPs is probably involved in the pathogenesis of conjunctival inflammation, remodelling and corneal changes.\r\n- Growth factors: Several growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor are increased in VKC. These factors induce fibroblast growth and pro-collagen production.\r\nCells in VKC:\r\nMast cells, eosinophils, T-lymphocytes, and natural killer cells are seen in increased number in VKC.\r\n- Mast cells: Mast cells play a key role in initiating inflammatory cascade. Mast cells are the constant feature of conjunctival tissue in patients of VKC. Increased number of mast cells in palpebral giant cells suggests an active role for these cells in abnormal connective tissue metabolism observed in VKC.\r\n- Eosinophils: Eosinophils are the constant feature seen in lacrimal and conjunctival cytology. Majority of cells in tears during active phase of VKC are eosinophils. Eosinophils and mast cells are the main effector cells in ocular inflammation in VKC.\r\n- T-lymphocytes: T-lymphocytes increase in conjunctiva of patients with VKC. T-lymphocytes play a vital role in the pathogenesis of chronic allergic inflammation.\r\n- B-lymphocytes: B-lymphocytes are responsible for IgE.\r\n- Natural killer cells: Increased Natural killer cells in conjunctiva suggests a potential role of these cells and innate immunity in VKC.\r\n- Epithelial cells: Epithelial cells act as mechanical barrier and participate in regulation of allergic inflammation.\r\n- Fibroblasts: Fibroblasts, maintains tissue structure, contribute to the induction and amplification of ocular allergic inflammation and tissue remodelling.\r\n\r\nVKC should be differentiated from:\r\n- Atopic keratoconjunctivitis.\r\n- Giant papillary conjunctivitis.\r\n- Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis.\r\n- Bacterial conjunctivitis.\r\n- Viral conjunctivitia.\r\n- Keratoconus."

                "Management should be carried out under medical supervision.\r\nEducation of patients and their parents about the chronic, recurrent and ultimately resolving nature of disease is an important aspect of management. Compliance with medical advice is better with a well-informed patient.\r\nMedical therapy:\r\nGeneral measures:\r\n- Avoid non-specific triggering stimuli: Avoid non-specific triggering stimuli such as exposure to wind, sun and salt water which causes frequent conjunctival redness.\r\n- Avoid allergens: Contact with common allergens like plants and flowers should be avoided.\r\n- Sunglasses: Use of protective sunglasses is helpful and should be advised.\r\n- Artificial tears: Artificial tears have been shown to be effective in relief of symptoms by direct removal and dilution of allergens from the ocular surface.\r\n- Cold compresses: cold compresses provide symptomatic relief, especially from ocular pruritus.\r\n- Frequent washing: Frequent face, hand and hair washing, especially before going to bed, may be helpful.\r\nDrug therapy:\r\nMost drugs used are merely palliative, and are not enough to treat and eliminate allergic ocular inflammation, so there is recurrence of disease on discontinuation of therapy.\r\nJudicious and scrupulous use of medicines is important because drug treatment is prolonged and frequent. Some patients may need medicine throughout the year for satisfactory symptomatic relief.\r\nDrugs to treat VKC include:\r\nVariety of currently available drugs to treat VKC includes vasoconstrictors, anti-histamines, mast-cell stabiliser, dual-action drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, immunomodulators and anti-metabolites.\r\n- Topical vasoconstrictor and non-specific anti-histamines: Topical vasoconstrictor and non-specific anti-histamine combination eye-drops are being used for long and are safe and effective, at least temporarily. Being available over the counter, these are tried by many patients during early stage of disease. These medicines relieve itching and reduce redness of eyes. There may be burning or stinging on instillation and rebound hyperaemia on discontinuation. This group contain vasoconstrictors like naphazoline or tetrahydrozoline and anti-histamines like pyrilamine and pheniramine.\r\n- Systemic anti-histamines: Systemic oral anti-histamines may be used when allergy involves the eyes, pharynx and nose simultaneously. For allergic complaints limited to eyes, topical anti-histamines are prescribed and are free of untoward side-effects of systemic oral anti-histamines. Topical anti-histamines provide faster relief than systemic anti-histamines and have longer duration of action than topical vasoconstrictors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pure mast cell stabilisers and corticosteroids, the drugs commonly used in the treatment of ocular allergy.\r\n- Topical mast-cell stabilisers: Topical mast-cell stabilisers prevent mast-cell degranulation or antagonise the effects of primary mediator histamine, being released by mast cells. Drug modulation of mast cell activity alleviates acute symptoms of active disease and reduces development of chronic allergic inflammation. These medicines may be used at the onset of allergic season and continued throughout the season. This group contain drugs like sodium cromoglycate, lodoxamide, nedocromil and pemirolast.\r\n- Topical selective H1 receptor blockers: Topical selective H1 receptor blockers are better than vasoconstrictors alone or in combination with non-specific anti-histamine eye-drops, in controlling signs and symptoms of VKC. The group contains drugs like emedastine and levocabastine. The enhanced clinical efficacy of these medicines over first-generation anti-histamines like pheniramine may be due to inhibitory effects of new-generation anti-histamines on the pro-inflammatory cytokines.\r\n- H1 receptor blocker and mast-cell stabiliser (dual action drugs): New generation of drugs show dual activity of H1 receptor antagonism and mast-cell stabilising property. Drugs in this group are olopatadine, epinastine, azelastine and ketotifen. These drugs also exert anti-inflammatory effects through other mechanisms e.g. olopatadine affects release of cytokines and ketotifen prevents eosinophil accumulation.\r\n- Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs diminish ocular pruritus and conjunctival redness associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Drugs in this group are ketorolac and diclofenac. These medicines inhibit pruritogenic prostaglandin production, and are good alternative to corticosteroids.\r\n- Topical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroids are one of the most effective medicines to control symptoms of VKC. These should not be prescribed as first-line treatment due to associated complications with their prolonged use viz. Steroid-induced cataract, glaucoma and susceptibility to viral and fungal infections. Modified steroids such as loteprednol etabonate and rimexolone may be used, and loteprednol has superior safety profile.\r\nAlthough corticosteroids are the most efficacious medicines, steroid-resistant forms of VKC are not unusual and may necessitate alternative treatment.\r\n- Immunomodulators: Immunomodulators like cyclosporine, a fungal metabolite, decreases signs and symptoms of VKC. However, symptoms may recur after discontinuation of cyclosporine eye-drops. Topical corticosteroids and artificial tears have been shown to act synergistically with cyclosporine eye-drops and help in re-epithelialisation of corticosteroid-resistant shield ulcers.\r\n- Anti-metabolites: Anti-metabolites like Mitomycin-C (MMC) is an inhibitor of fibroblast proliferation. MMC decreases mucoid discharge, conjunctival hyperaemia and limbal oedema in patients who are refractory to topical steroids and mast-cell stabilisers.\r\nSurgical therapy:\r\nFollowing surgical measures may be taken:\r\n- Excision of giant papillae: Surgical excision of giant papillae is recommended if they cause lesions on the cornea. Excision of large papillae helps in early resolution of corneal epitheliopathy or ulcer, although papillae may regrow. Intra-operative application of MMC to upper palpebral conjunctiva immediately after papillae resection significantly reduces the chances of recurrence of papillae.\r\n- Cryotherapy: Like excision of papillae, cryocoagulation may also helps in resolution of corneal epitheliopathy or ulcer. Cryotherapy of giant papillae leads to inflammation and may cause conjunctival scarring.\r\n- Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser: Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser may be used to remove giant papillae. This procedure may be repeated on recurrence of papillae.\r\n- Debridement of ulcer base: Debridement of ulcer base may promote re-epithelialisation.\r\n- Removal of plaque: Surgical removal of plaque may also promote re-epithelialisation.\r\n- Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK) helps in early re-epithelialisation of vernal shield ulcer refractory to medical treatment.\r\n- Free autologous (derived from self) conjunctival graft: Free autologous conjunctival graft after resection of giant papillae facilitates re-epithelialisation of non-healing shield ulcer.\r\n- Amniotic membrane graft: Amniotic membrane graft leads to complete re-epithelialisation of persistent corneal epithelial defects and vernal plaques, not improving by conventional medical treatment.\r\n- Cultivated corneal epithelial cells: Cultivated corneal epithelial cells may be transplanted to treat severe ocular surface disease. There is significant improvement in vision after transplant. Corneal epithelial cell transplant is beneficial when amniotic membrane graft is not sufficient to restore ocular surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis:\r\nIn general, VKC is rather a benign and self-limiting disease that resolves with age or spontaneously at puberty. However, active disease is debilitating and necessitates therapy to contol signs and symptoms. In some patients, symptoms may persist beyond puberty into adulthood.\r\nVKC may lead to significant vision affecting corneal complications such as scarring, ulceration and opacification. Lid involvement may significantly compromise contact lens tolerance.\r\nMedications used for the disease may lead to complications such as preservative toxicity and steroid-induced glaucoma (raised intra-ocular pressure) or cataract."

                "West Nile fever is a zoonotic disease (an animal disease affecting humans). Disease is caused by West Nile virus (WNV), which is a flavivirus related to the viruses that cause St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever. West Nile virus is mainly transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. WNV is maintained in nature by transmission between birds and mosquitoes; as birds are the natural hosts of the virus. Humans, horses and other mammals can be infected.\r\nWest Nile fever can cause severe neurological illness and death in people, however about 80% of people who are infected show no symptoms.\r\nWest Nile virus was first isolated in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937. An epidemic of West Nile fever was reported in humans in Israel in 1951. In 1999 WNV was imported in New York and produced a large outbreak that spread throughout the continental United States of America (USA) during 1999-2010. Large outbreaks also occurred in Greece, Israel, Romania and Russia. The virus is now widely reported from Canada to Venezuela. Outbreak sites are on major birds\u2019 migratory routes. WNV is commonly found in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, North America and West Asia.\r\nWNV is highly prevalent in India. Infection usually presents as a mild, non-fatal dengue like illness in humans. Febrile illness and encephalitis cases in epidemic form were observed in Udaipur district of Rajasthan, Buldhana, Marathwada and Khandesh districts of Maharashtra. Human sera collected from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Rajasthan showed presence of WNV neutralizing antibodies. Serologically confirmed cases of WNV infections were reported from Vellore and Kolar districts during 1977, 1978 and 1981.\r\nPresence of WNV was documented in north- eastern region of India during the year 2006 from four districts (Japanese encephalitis (JE) endemic areas) of Assam; in which11.6% of serum samples of AES (acute encephalitis syndrome) cases were found positive for IgM against WNV (these samples were negative for IgM against JE virus). \r\nDuring an outbreak of AES in Kerala, in May 2011, presence of WNV was confirmed in clinical specimens. Since then, WNV encephalitis cases have regularly been reported in Kerala."

Humans, horses and other mammals can be infected.\r\nBirds acts both as carriers and amplifying host for WNV. Some bird species especially the crow family (corvidae) are more susceptible to the virus than others. Migratory birds are important in WNV transmission.\r\nOrnithophilic (feeds on birds) mosquitoes belonging mainly to Culex species act as vectors for transmission of infection from infected birds to vertebrate hosts such as Cx.modestus (france),Cx.Vishnui complex(India and Pakistan), Cx univittatus complex(South Africa), Cx. pipiens pipiens(Romania, USA).\r\nWhen Mosquitoes feed on an infected bird they become infected with the virus.

WNV is maintained in mosquito populations by transferring the infection through adults (mosquitoes) to eggs (vertical transmission).\r\nInfection of other animals (e.g. horses, and also humans) is incidental to the cycle in birds since most mammals do not develop enough viruses in the bloodstream to spread the disease.

                "Welding-arc maculopathy may develop following prolonged exposure to welding arc radiation without adequate protection of eyes. It generally affects young people because of their occupational lack of knowledge and also due to presence of relatively clear ocular media. Most common injury with welding arc radiation is photophthalmia due to ultraviolet (UV) light absorption. Welding-arc maculopathy may be underreported because of its transient clinical features, which may be masked by associated photokeratitis.\r\nThe effect of light on retina is being recognised since the time of Plato, who gave description of eclipse blindness.\r\nPhotic (related to light) retinopathy is a generalised term used for retinal damage produced by light. This may be due to solar viewing or may be produced even by use of operating microscope.\r\nIncrease in retinal temperature is below photocoagulation thresholds. The injury is due to photochemical effects from UV and short blue wavelength exposure. Similar photochemical macular burns may take place after brief exposure to the flash associated with short-circuiting of a high-tension electric current. Use of drug phenothiazine may increase the susceptibility to damage due to the welding-arc radiation.\r\nIn metal-arc inert gas welding, the arc is ensheathed with inert gas to prevent oxidation of molten metal. The gas changes emitted radiation into visible and infra-red range, which may produce thermal and photochemical damage to the retina. This is unlike electric arc where the radiation is predominantly in UV range.\r\nThe appearance of retinal lesions and clinical course of welding arc exposure are similar to those of solar retinopathy. However, welding-arc maculopathy requires more prolonged exposure as compared to solar retinopathy."

                "Xanthelasma (xanthelasma palpebrarum) is a raised, yellow, soft, plaque-like, velvety lesion most commonly seen in the medial canthal (inner junction between upper and lower eyelid) area of the eyelid. It is a common subcutaneous eyelid lesion. It tends to be bilateral and is more common in the elderly. It has slightly more female preponderance. Xanthelasma is known to occur as a result of hyperlipidaemia, hypercholesterolemia, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. Although some patients with xanthelasma have normal lipid levels, others may show hyperlipidaemia (usually type II) or secondary hyperlipidaemia owing to conditions such as biliary cirrhosis or diabetes mellitus.\r\nWhen it is large and nodular, it may assume tumourous proportions and is then called xanthoma. Tuberous xanthoma appears as solitary or multiple, placoid or papular lesion which has predilection for elbows, knees, fingers and buttocks. Multiple eruptive xanthomas may sometimes occur in patients.\r\nErasmus Wilson originally described xanthelasma about hundred years ago. This word is derived from the Greek Xanthos meaning \u2018yellow\u2019 and elasma, meaning \u2018beaten metal plate\u2019. Rarely these may be large enough to obstruct vision."

                "Xerophthalmia is a condition of early vitamin A deficiency in which cornea keratinises, become opaque and forms dry, scaly layers of cells. Affected cornea is susceptible to infection. The conjunctiva may keratinise and develop plaques known as Bitot\u2019s spots. In1863,PierreBitot,aFrenchphysician,first describedthesespots.\r\nThe eye lesions are primarily disease of the young and are a major cause of blindness in developing countries. Although rates of xerophthalmia have fallen, the number of affected children is still high.\r\nVitamin A deficiency\r\nThe risk of vitamin A deficiency is small in children who are getting vitamin A (retinol) or its precursors. Deficiency states are common in many developing countries and are often associated with global malnutrition. Barring impoverished populations, deficiency of vitamin A is rare in developed countries. Vitamin A deficiency may also be seen as a complication with various chronic disorders or diseases in children. Medical history related to dietary habits may be important in identifying nutritional disorders.\r\nIn eye, vitamin A is metabolised to form rhodopsin (retinal visual pigment). Action of light on rhodopsin is the initial step in the visual process.\r\nPre-formed vitamin A is available in foods of animal origin only. Vitamin A may be obtained from carotenes, which are present in green and coloured vegetables and yellow fruits. Carotenes provide vitamin A to the vegetarians.\r\nMalnutrition, especially protein deficiency, may also cause vitamin A deficiency. Clinical or sub-clinical zinc deficiency may also increase the risk of vitamin A deficiency.\r\nExcept for vitamin A, toxicity from excess intake of vitamins is less common. Excessive intake of carotene (precursor of vitamin A) may lead to pigmentation of skin (hypercarotenosis). This gets reduced and fades away when intake of carotene is reduced."

Vitamin A deficiency may also be seen as complication in children with various chronic disorders or diseases.

Yaws is the most common of all and occurs primarily in the warm, humid and tropical areas of Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Indian peninsula and the equatorial islands of South-East Asia.\r\nYaws is caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Yaws is not a fatal disease, but causes disabilities and visible deformities of the face and extremities contributing to stigma and discrimination. It affects the skin, bone and cartilage; if left untreated it can lead to deformities of the nose and bones of the leg. However, the disease can be cured and prevented by a single dose of antibiotics.\r\nIn India cases were first reported among tea plantation labourers in Assam in1887. Later on cases occurred in Orissa, Chattishgarh, Madhya Pradesh and other areas.\r\nIn India the disease is mostly known by the name of the tribes affected most in any region. Thus for example, the disease is called \u2018Madia Roga\u2019 and \u2018Gondi Roga\u2019 in Bastar area of Chattishgarh and Sironcha area of Maharashtra respectively and \u2018Koya rogam\u2019 in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. Some synonyms of Yaws are based on clinical features like \u2018Domaru Khahu\u2019 in Assam which indicates fig like eruption. Chakawar is a term used for chronic ulcers in Central India and part of Uttar Pradesh.\r\nThe disease was reported from tribal inhabited districts in states of Chattishgarh, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. Cases of Yaws were also reported from Madhya Pradesh, Tamilnadu, Assam, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat.\r\nThe disease has been eliminated from India in 2006 as no new yaws case has been reported after 2003 in the country. It has long been considered by World Health Organization (WHO) that Yaws can be eradicated because humans are the only reservoir.\r\nEradication of Yaws in India is possible because man is the only reservoir of infection; a single injection of long acting penicillin was effective; infection was localised to small pockets and; no case has been reported after 2003."

This papilloma is full of organisms and may persist for 3\u20136 months followed by natural healing. Nocturnal bone pain and bone lesions may also occur in the early stage. These primary skin lesions (Early Yaws) usually occur in children and adolescents in endemic areas.\r\nLate yaws appears after 5 years of the initial infection and is characterized by disfigurement of the nose and bones, and thickening and cracking of the palms of the hand and soles of the feet. These complications on the soles of the feet make it difficult for patients to walk. Late yaws are non-infectious but may make a person disabled."

                "Yaws is caused by Treponema pertenue which closely resembles to T.pallidium. It is a slender spirochete that is serologically indistinguishable from the spirochete T.pallidium which causes syphilis. The agents found in the epidermis of the lesions, lymph glands, spleen and bone marrow. The organism rapidly dies outside the tissues.\r\nReservoir of infection- Man is the only known reservoir of yaws. Clinical lesions relapse 2-3 times or more during the first 5 years of infections and serve as source for new infections. The most latent cases are found in clusters centered around an infectious case. There are frequent relapses in latent cases\r\nTransmission-Yaws is transmitted through direct (person-to-person), non-sexual contact with the fluid from the lesion of an infected person to an uninfected persons through minor injuries. Most lesions occur on the limbs. The initial lesion of yaws is filled with the bacteria. The incubation period is 9\u201390 days (average 21 days).\r\nAbout 75% of people affected are children under 15 years old (peak incidence occurs in children aged 6\u201310 years). Males and females are equally affected.\r\nOvercrowding, poor hygiene and poor socioeconomic conditions favours the spread of the yaws"

                "Yaws simulates the lesions of scabies, impetigo, skin tuberculosis, tinea versicolor, tropical ulcer, leprosy and psoriasis. It may also accompany these diseases. Penicillin treatment is very useful in differential diagnosis because of miraculous relief seen in yaws but not in other skin diseases.\r\nMost latent and incubating cases are found in clusters around an infectious case and can usually be diagnosed by epidemiological tracing.\r\nSerology-\r\nStandard laboratory-based tests-\r\nSerological tests are widely used to diagnose treponemal infections (e.g. syphilis and yaws). Serological tests cannot distinguish yaws from syphilis and its interpretation on adults in yaws endemic areas (disease constantly present in a particular region) need careful clinico-epidemiological assessment.\r\nCommonly used tests are Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test and the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test which are inexpensive, rapid and simple to perform. It takes time for sero-positivity to appear after the onset of disease and hence, initial (mother) case may be sero-negative.\r\nRapid point-of-care tests (medical testing at or near the site of patient care)-Rapid tests allow the point-of-care diagnosis and treatment of patients. There are 2 types of rapid tests:\r\nRapid treponemal tests are widely used in the diagnosis of syphilis; however, these tests cannot distinguish between present active yaws and past infections. Therefore, its use alone could lead to overtreatment of patients and over-reporting of cases.\r\nNew rapid dual (non-treponemal and treponemal) point-of-care syphilis test allows simultaneous yet separate detection of both antibodies. It is now being used in yaws eradication efforts.\r\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR)-Genomic analysis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)can be used to definitely confirm yaws, and this test will be very useful in the last phase of the eradication programme. The PCR technique can also be used to determine azithromycin resistance from swabs taken from yaws lesions."
